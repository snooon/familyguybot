(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey! Welcome to Bonnie's29th birthday party.
(LAUGHS) I...I can't keep this up!She's 46!
Here, we brought you guysan orchid from Trader Joe's,
because we don't know or careabout any of your interests.
Well, I put together some videosfor Bonnie's party.
Here we are on our honeymoon.
# LATIN MUSIC
Yeah, Cabo was great.
We even went backfor our tenth anniversary.
# LATIN MUSIC
Better wrap it up, honey.Tide's comin' in.
Let's break for presents.
After that, I'll show youSusie's birth video.
I'll tell ya -she fell out of there
like an orangeout of an old dress sack.
Ugh, I have to text Rupertwhat a train wreck this is.
(PHONE SQUEAKS)Hey, I want real things!
(TOILET FLUSHES)
Kinda weird they're keepingall our jackets in the tub.
(CRYING)
Bonnie? I told you, Joe.
When we're alone,you can call me Bonald.
No, it's me, Brian.
Is that your real name?I mean, are you OK?
Sorry. Am I allowed on the bed?
I guess so. What's wrong?
Nothing. I have something in my eye.
Yes, you do. It looks like sadness.
Come on, you can tell me.I'm your neighbour's dog.
I don't know. When I was young,
I had so many things I wanted to dowith my life.
But now I'm 46,
and all I've ever doneis take care of Joe.
And now you feel like you never hada chance to be your true self.
Yeah. I know just how you feel.
I mean, I'm happy that Peterfound me and gave me a home,
but...sometimes I wonderif I'd be happier on my own.
Exactly! It's like, sometimes,I feel... Trapped?
No, I was going to say,like the Von Trapps.
You know, unable to leave their homein Austria.
Oh. Well, that still isremarkably close.
Thanks for being so nice to me,Brian.
Why are you scratchingbehind my ear?
I...I don't know, I thoughtit might make you feel better.
It does feel kinda nice.
You're a good girl,you're gonna be OK.
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't mean -
No, it's OK. Um...
I'd better go downstairsbefore Joe realises I'm gone...
And before Peter gets into the stuffthat's not for the party.
PETER: Ah, Halloween candy!JOE: Peter, get out of the pantry!
I can't believe I just kissedmy friend's wife!
I'm a bigger scumbag than Spock!
I heard that there was a Romulanship spotted in our sector,
which means - Hey. Hey!
Ga-la-la-la-la.
Kids, this morning PrincipalShepherd wanted to say a few words.
Thank you, Mrs Abbott.Before I start,
are these the normal kids,or kinda the duh-duh ones?
It's a healthy mix.Good morning, children.
It's that time of the year again
to fulfil your community servicerequirement
by signing up for volunteer work.Do we get to choose our own jobs?
No, no, no. The jobs will beassigned randomly,
but the cooler and prettier studentshave the better jobs.
For instance, blonde chickin the third row
will wash my car this afternoon.
While Little Miss Frumpkinwith all the questions
will work in an old folks' home.
Is Frumpkin good? (LAUGHS) No, no.
Brian, what are you doing up solate? I'm having trouble sleeping.
I gotta tell you something.
I kissed Bonnie last night.
What?! I know, I know,it was a huge mistake.
so let's just dotwo or three high fives
and then forget it ever happened.If Joe finds out, he'll kill ya!
No kidding. That's why youcan't tell anybody. Promise me.
Don't worry, don't worry.I'm great at keeping secrets.
Except for that one time youdiscovered my hidden shame.
Peter?! Brian! I'm...uh...
I'm sorry.I'm one of these guys now.
I'm sorry, Brian!
I'm sorry.
Mrs Parkhurst? I'm Meg,your new student volunteer.
Oh, you must bemy new student volunteer.
Yeah, I just said that.What's your name, dear?
It's Meg. Can I get a new person?
Nonsense! Come in.
And between you and me,I hate my new student volunteer.
That ugly little Meg.
She says she's a girl, but shecertainly has a boy's body odour.
(SIGHS)
(DOORBELL)
Oh! Come on in. Peter, Joe andBonnie are here for game night.
Game night? Yeah, I figuredit's the least we could do
since you pulled up a beheadingvideo on your phone at their partyand showed it to everyone.
It was really more abouthow loud my phone can get.
Peter, we're doing this.(SIGHS) All right.
But the operation gameis out of batteries
so I'll have to make the noise.(BUZZES)
You hear that?That's the sound of bad surgery.
All right, I'm awesome at charades.
Guys are going first. OK, go!
Uh... About a Boy!
Uh... Four Weddings and a Funeral!
Uh... Nine Months!
Notting Hill!Yes, it was Notting Hill!
I'm gonna go get more wine.
Oh...hey. Hi, Brian.
Um...listen,about the other night...
You haven't told anyone, have you?
No, no, of course not.I was gonna ask if you had.
Hey, Brian, can you bring me up asnack? I'm supposed to be in bed.
Look, the other night was great,but...
it was a mistake. You're right.
Oh, man, what?!
Yeah, there's definitely some kindof connection between us, but -
I felt it too,but maybe in another life, huh?
(SIGHS) Yeah, I guess you're right.
This could never work.Like porn movies before sound.
(MOANS)
(GRUNTS)
Ooh.
Oh, there you are.Come on, Bonnie, it's Joe's turn.
OK, here we go. Uh... crippled guy.
Uh... cheating wife. Uh...
Uh... cheating wifeof a crippled guy.
A dog? Something with a dog.Dog kiss?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) I thinkthat's time, your turn is over!
Oh, sounds like. Sounds likedog kisses crippled guy's wife
at your party.Wait, wait, I know it!
The other night at your party,Brian kissed Bonnie. (GASPING)
Bonnie, is this true?
Oh, my God!
I know, making out with a dog?!Can you even imagine a woman
who possibly does that for real?!
Uh...hi, Joe. Hi, Brian.
Look, I want to apologisefor what happened.
I didn't mean to kiss Bonnie.
Everybody had a little too muchto drink, it just happened.
I hope we're still cool.
Hey, don't worry about it.It was a crazy party.
We ran out of salsa! (CHUCKLES)
How do you run out of salsa?!
Anyway, we're good.
(SIGHS) Oh, really? Thank God!
I... I was worried you'd be mad!
Mad? At my buddy Brian?
Not a chance. Hey, is that your car?
What? No! What's he doing?My car was parked legally!
Huh. Well, maybe your car violatedsome sort of unspoken boundary,
one that nobody bothers to codifybecause it's just common decency.
Hey, Joe, is that the guy?
Read your texts, Jerry.Not supposed to say you know me.
I hope your day gets better, Brian,
but I wouldn't count on it.
(LAUGHS VINDICTIVELY)
Phwoar, it wasn't easy,Mrs Parkhurst.
But I think we got the nail thatwas poking through your slipper.
Well, you strike me as someonewho's never going to get married,
that's for sure.Now get me my itch cream!
Is it in the drawer? Shut up!I'm trying to hum atonally
(HUMS)
(SIGHS)
Here's your cream. See you Thursday.
Oh, my God! I can't believeI stole this!
You know what? I don't feel bad.That woman's a nightmare.
(GASPS) Ooh, I should text thisto my best friend.
(PHONE CHIMES) Sick brooch!
Adam, are you donewith that mayor homework yet?
It's called a bill, Mom.
Hey, Brian. I...know that thingshave been awkward between us,
but just to show youthere's no hard feelings,
can I buy you a drink?You know what? Sure. Thanks.
What the hell happened?
Argh! How do I walk?!Are these forever?!
I also rubbed my butt on youwhile you were unconscious.
I like to put stuff online.
Meg, Mom said that -Hey, what's all this stuff?
Stuff I stolefrom the old folks' home.
But you should seehow they treat me.
Meg, that's no excuse.Stealing is just plain -
Oh, my God!Is that someone else's glasses?!
I love wearingother people's glasses!
(GIGGLES)
Do I look like I stoleatomic secrets?! You do!
Wow, this is awesome! I want in!
And there's the splitting headachefrom wearing someone else's glasses.
OK, Chris, here's a roomI haven't hit yet.
Here, follow my lead.
Who's there?Why are you in my room?!
Oh, hi. You died and I'm hereto take you to heaven.
Um...oopsy daisy, here we go!
Well, now that I'm in heaven...(FARTS)
Hurry, take everything!And be quick,
or we'll be in bigger troublethan a fat guy at a water park.
Come on, Dad,let's go on the water slide!
(SIGHS) I can't fit.I'm afraid I'll get stuck.
I'll just go in the lazy river.
But, Dad - No, son,this is the life I've chosen.
# When your day is long *
# And the night
# The night is yours alone
# And you're sure you've -(MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY)
(MUSIC RESUMES) #..had enough
# Of this life
Guys, thanks again for doing this.Joe has been making my life hell.
Of course. Now, when Joe gets here,we're gonna tell himhe needs to lighten up on Brian,
and then we'll all talk this thingout so we can move past it.
And then I get to showmy card trick? If there's time.
Let's make this quick.
What's going on? What's all this?
We all know what happenedand we're here for you.
But we think you're taking thisrevenge on Brian a little too far.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, come on.It's like, enough is enough.
CLEVELAND: The Triscuits are therosemary kind, not the regular kind.
Me?! I'm not the guywho violated the sanctityof someone else's marriage.
Well, you make a good point, Joe.And you're right, this is Brian.
We all know he don't carewhere he gets his wick wet!
Just ask Quagmire's father.
OK, we might be gettinga little off track here.
Yeah, Brian's right.Joe, you're out of control.
Even though Brian's been tryingto do my wife for years,and on some level I hate him for it.
Oh, Brian's a complete dick,we all know that.
But I think we're losing sight ofthe point that Bonnie's a weird slut
who's always letting you knowshe's open for business.When am I doing that?!
Oh, come on! When are you not doingthat? With that boo-boo baby voice
and that still-breastfeeding rack.Ooh, gimme some of that!
I'm Bonnie's friend, but she couldsometimes get the mail
in something other than a robe.OK, so we're all in agreement.
Bonnie and Brianare terrible people.
Quagmire, I want you to think of acard but do not tell me what it is.
OK, enough! How dare any of youcriticise Bonnie?
For years, she gave up her own dreamsto take care of Joe.
And yeah, maybe she kissed me.Maybe she needed to
because she feels so trappedin her marriage! It's true!
No-one ever takes the timeto ask how I feel!
Brian's the only one.
They don't get us, Bonnie,and you deserve better than this.
We both do. You know what?
Let's get outta here.
Wow, we are zero for twoon interventions today.
I'm not changing for nobody!
You're... You're the oneswith the problems!
Ah, we did it. We don't needthose narrow-minded losers.
This is so exciting. We can finallylive the lives we've always wanted.
Like, I can finally startmy jewellery design business,
making earrings for tweens.
Listen. Hear that?
That is the sound of not makingan enormous mistake.
I think I hear it!
(BEEPING) Oh, hang on.Looks like we need gas.
So...do you have, like,a credit card?
Nope. And no cash, either.
But...I don't care. I couldn't standanother moment with Joe.
It was torture just watching himdo a crossword puzzle.
Hey, Bonnie, what's a five-letterword for marriage?
Fraud. It's gotta start with a 'U'.
Union! Boy, you stink at this.
(GRAMOPHONE PLAYS SWING MUSIC)
Boy, it's just so comfortingto be here,
surrounded by other people'smemories.
Back into the sleeve with you.
Can you hand me another nylonthat I use as a sock
with my huge beige shoe? Sure!
Can you hand me that ashtray?I might fire up this pipe again.
Chris, that's not an ashtray!That's an urn for someone's ashes.
Really? Yeah. You've been puttingyour pipe out in some guy!
Oh, my God. What are we doing?!
I feel awful. We need to giveeverything back.
Oh, you're right.
We need to do the right thing,like the dad from Small Wonder.
All right, Vicky,time to shut you down for the night.
(ROBOTIC VOICE) Good night.See you tomorrow... (POWERS DOWN)
(INHALES) Nah.
(SIGHS) She's really gone.
And she took little Susie with her.
I miss that baby more than anything.
(BABY CRIES)
Oh, I guess she left it here.
Joe, I want you to know I will notsupport that relationship.
If Brian and Bonnie get married,I will not go.
Although Brian might want meto be his best man.
Then I'd have to go.And I'd have to dance.
It'd be weird to be best manand not dance.
And I'd have to give a toastand say Bonnie's the best thingthat ever happened to him.
She IS the best thing that everhappened to him. But don't worry,
I'll only refer to youas Bonnie's ex.
You know, like, "Bonnie has an ex,but Brian marks the spot!"
Oh, Peter, that's good!Thanks, babe.
I hope Brian and Bonnieare as happy as us.
To Brian and Bonnie!
Bad news. The teenage runawaysat table four were not big tippers.
We just need enough moneyto get to Taos.
That's like the capital of makingand selling your own jewellery.
OK, enough about the jewellery.Do you even know how to make it?
I know how to make jewellery.I just don't know...
how to make the metalgo into shapes.
Hey, you know what'd be great? (!)If you could talk
with even a little bit of inflectionto your voice,
so it doesn't sound so much likea (BLEEP) power sounder. Screw you!
You tweet things that aren't worthtweeting! Well, I'm sorry,
but Kim Kardashian did get famousfor making a sex tape!
We all know that! That's not yours.
And stop breathing through yourmouth, it's really annoying.
I'm panting! That's how I sweat,you dumb bitch!
No it isn't,dogs sweat through their paws.
You're such a know-it-all, Brian,
you don't even knowabout your own body!
At least I've had an orgasm!
Wow. I am sorry.
Look, this isn't us.
This is just the no foodand sleeping in a car talking.
We can make this work, like coupleswho meet on Craigslist.
BOTH: You're not what you look likein your picture.
Let's get this over with.
I wonder which one of usis the murderer!
OK, we ditch the stuffin the day room,
and then I'm donewith my volunteer hours
and we never come back here again.
Mrs Parkhurst?
Look at you two.Stealing from the elderly!
You're worse than that JulietteLewis who makes out with dogs.
Wait, is that a real thing?!Where did you hear that?What are your sources?
Listen, we're very sorrywe stole from you,
but you have it all back now,so...we cool, right?
You know, I should call the policeon you. The police?!
Or maybe instead,we do things my way.
What's that?You will spend time with us
every afternoon after school,
doing jigsaw puzzles,reading us the newspaper,
listening to poorly-rememberedstories that have no point.
You monster!
Sit down!
Now, I feel some dementia coming.
Feed me puddingwhile I grip your wrist in terror!
(GASPS) This isn't my house!
If I make under 20 grandfor 20 years,
my film school debt goes away,that's a government rule.
Bonnie? Joe?
How did you find me?
Love is a powerful compass.
Any time I quiet my mindand clear my heart,
it always leads me to you.
Plus, dirtbag here has a chipin his ear.
I do?! Dammit. No wonder Peter'sso good at hide and seek.
You're under the canoein Quagmire's yard. Son of a bitch!
Bonnie, I understand nowwhy you left.
Over the years, I've probably becometoo dependent on you,
and...I'm sorry if you've had toput your dreams on hold
because of me. Oh, Joe!
But I'm here to fight for you,Bonnie.
If you're willing to come back home,
I promise I'll spend the restof my days taking care of you,
just the wayyou've always taken care of me.
Of course I wanna come home, Joe.I love you.
Wow. I guess just call me Cupid,huh? (CHUCKLES) You're welcome.
Ow, dammit! (GROANS)
Hey, Bri, came to try that apple pieyou were texting about.
Oh, you're shot.
Well, Chris and I sure learned a lotthis week.
(SCOFFS) Ha! You think you learneda lot? I had quite an adventure.
You know what, guys?We only got 15 seconds left.
We have to do theseat the same time. Let's race.
And...go! (ALL TALK OVER EACH OTHER)
(TALKING OVER EACH OTHER CONTINUES)
(LAUGHS) Same old Meg! You rascal!
And the winner is...nobody.
Especially not you. Good night!
