 ? It seems today 
 that all you see ? 
? Is violence in movies 
 and sex on TV ? 
? But where are those 
 good old-fashioned values ? 
? On which we used to rely? ? 
? Lucky there's a family guy ? 
? Lucky there's a man 
 who positively can do ? 
? All the things that make us ? 
? Laugh and cry ? 
? He's... a... 
 Fam... ily... Guy! ? 
All right. Empty school. 
Time to Shining my way 
 through the halls. 

? ? 
Principal Shepherd, 
 where is everyone?! 
(in low, monotone voice): 
 Principal Shepherd's not here, 
Miss Griffin. 
Why are you talking like that? 
Sorry. That was Tony, 
the little boy 
 who lives in my mouth. 
Why are you here? 
 It's skip day. 
It's skip day? 
 Nobody told me. 
She's unpopular 
 and unattractive. 
Tony! 
Hello?! Chris? 
Did you know it was skip day? 
Mom? Dad?

(beeps) 
(phone ringing) 
Hello? 
MEG: 
 Mom? Where are you guys? 
Who is this? 
It's Meg. 
 Where is everyone? 
Well, this can't be Meg. 
She's with us here at the pier. 
-Who is that? 
 -Someone who says she's Meg. 
Give me that. 
Okay, Meg, if this is you, 
 what's your birthday? 
March 23. 
I have no idea 
 if that's correct. 
-Good day, sir. 
 -(beeps) 
Sorry about that, everyone. 
Now let's get back to the fair 
 and enjoy our March 23. 
(bowling pins clacking, 
 quiet chatter) 
The usual, please. 
Here ya are-- 
 ladies' seven on the left, 
and men's 11 on the right. 
I just need a license. 
Thanks. 
Oh! And happy birthday! 
Yes! 
(Western-style theme plays) 
BRUCE (singsongy): 
 We have not updated those. 
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker. 
Coming up, 
 I find even more sand 
on my body from a beach toilet 
 I used a week ago. 
But first, 
 tragedy strikes close to home, 
as a car crash near 
 my apartment claims the life 
of a local teen girl. 
The victim's identity 
 is being withheld 
pending notification 
 of the family. 
(knocking) 
Hey, buddy. 
What brings you around at this 
 late hour with your uniform on 
and your hat held mournfully 
 against your chest? 
Peter, Lois, 
 it pains me above the waist 
to tell you that Meg is dead. 
-What?! 
 -What are you talking about? 
Meg's right here. 
(wind whistling) 
(all gasp) 
You know, it's weird that didn't
 happen on the pier all day. 
Or when we rented 
 that convertible. 
How did this happen?! 
She got in a car wreck, and 
 was burned beyond recognition, 
and I leveled up on Fortnite 
 this weekend, 
but you probably only care 
 about the first two things. 
Oh, dear God, no! (cries) 
All we found was Meg's 
 driver's license at the scene. 
It had her Quiznos punch card 
 stuck to the back. 
Your little angel was 
one stamp away from a free sub, 
which only adds 
 to this horrific tragedy. 
It's actually pretty impressive,
because the card was only issued
 three days ago. 
Usually one of the guys would 
 swipe a thing like this, 
use it on the way home, 
 but I snagged it for ya. 
Thought Meg's family ought 
 to be the ones 
to enjoy the free sandwich. 
Again, I'm very sorry. 
(lights buzzing) 
TOM: 
 Oh, hang on. 
Oh, they told the family? 
 Great! 
The girl killed near 
 my apartment was Meg Griffin. 
What? I'm not dead! 
She was burned 
 beyond recognition 
but identified 
 by her driver's license. 
156 pounds. 
Yikes. 
Wait. Did you give my ID 
 to the wrong girl? 
Sorry. Them shoe spray fumes 
 made me all goofy in my head. 
(inhales deeply) 
I'm still sober. 
 This ain't cheatin'! 
Oh, this is me being sober! 
(sighs) 
So I guess I'm dead. 
And no one cares. 
TOM: 
 Again, for those of you 
in a new scene: 
 Meg Griffin dead. 
(sad, orchestral music plays) 
? ? 
(organ plays solemn hymn) 
Lois, 
 can you believe these seats? 
Front row! 
I hope the priest pulls me up 
 on stage and dances with me. 
When I was hastily relocated 
 to this parish a week ago, 
the last thing 
 I thought I'd have to do is 
stand before you 
 on such a sad occasion. 
A family losing a child is like 
a Trivial Pursuit wheel 
 losing a pie piece. 
And you have to keep reminding 
 everyone playing the game, 
"Don't forget. I already got 
 'Entertainment'." What a pain. 
Your first speaker-- 
 Principal Shepherd. 
Meg Griffin was an honest man, 
a kind man, 
 a man who knew how... 
(whispering) 
Oh, my stars! 
I have nothing. 
Kind of feel bad. 
 There's nobody here. 
I know. We're not even here. 
(electrical hissing) 
(video game beeping) 
This was the right decision. 
Hey, Chris, I'm super sorry 
 your sister is dead. 
Mwah. 
If there's anything 
 we can do to help you 
during your time of need... 
-Stamps. 
 -(laughs) What? 
Stamps. I need stamps. 
Okay, you got it. 
Wow. Are girls coming on to me 
 because my sister died? 
Cool! 
BONNIE: 
 God, I wish 
 it was Joe in that box. 
I do, too, Bon. 
Oh. Did I say that out loud? 
No, but at this point, 
 I know what you're thinking. 
It'll be soon, babe. 
Unbelievable. 
There's hardly anyone here. 
Ugh. Well, that's it. 
I'm off to a new town 
 to start a new life. 
Ooh. Sorry. 
Don't you know what a rosary 
 on a doorknob means?! 
(rolling thunder) 
(inhales) 
Siri, play "Kiss From a Rose" 
 by Seal. 
("Kiss From a Rose" plays, 
seal barking instead of lyrics) 
(sighs) 
I hope everyone enjoys 
 tonight's dinner. 
(Lois cries quietly) 
It... it was Meg's favorite. 
(sobbing) 
There, there, Lois. 
 Stop your crying. 
-Stop it. 
 -(continues crying) 
Please stop. Stop. 
Stop it. Stop crying. 
Stop crying. 
Stop crying. Stop. 
(sighs) 
 Before we eat, 
would anyone like 
 to say something about Meg? 
Okay, I feel all of you 
 looking at me, so here goes. 
Meg, wherever you are, 
I hope that you're with Bubba, 
 and I want you to know 
that Lieutenant Dan 
 is walking around... 
Is this from Forrest Gump? 
I miss you, Meg. (crying) 
Stop it, Brian. 
Stop your crying. 
Stop it. 
Please stop. 
Stop. Stop it. 
Stop crying. 
 Stop crying. 
Stop crying. Stop. 
Stewie, is there anything 
 you'd like to say? 
Yeah. We're gonna save a lot 
 of money on toilet paper. 
Ever see her wipe? 
She'd wrap up both hands 
 like oven mitts 
and act like she was cleaning 
 out a pot of burnt chili. 
Anyway, that's all 
 I care to say about Meg. 
Maybe we should just have 
 a moment of silence 
as we hear the guy 
 down the street 
scream at his barking dog. 
(dog barking) 
MAN: 
 Damn it, Rufus, shut up! 
Will you shut up?! 
Get in the house! 
 Get in the house! 
? This time things are gonna 
 work out fine ? 
? This time will be better 
 than previous times ? 
? This time is 
 markedly different ? 
? Than the times 
 we had before ? 
? This time is gonna be 
 so much more! ? 
(harmonica riff plays) 
? Or maybe it's not. ? 
(knocking) 
 Hi, new neighbor. 
I just thought 
 I'd come by and see 
if I could borrow a cup 
 of tampons. 
Sure. Just bring 'em back 
 when you're done. No rush. 
Thanks. My name's not important.
What's yours? 
Um... my name? 
My name is... 
Hallway. 
Natalie Hallway. 
Nice to meet you, Natalie. 
You want to join us on the roof 
 and sit under string lights? 
That sounds great! 
I'll bring my hemorrhoid donut 
 to sit on. 
(laughs) 
Great joke, Natalie Hallway! 
Yes. It is a joke. 
Because Natalie Hallway 
 doesn't need 
to sit on a hemorrhoid donut. 
(insects chirping) 
To Natalie Hallway, 
 our new friend. 
Natalie, sit down. 
 Tell us about yourself. 
Yow...! 
What a view! 
You know, Stewie, 
 when Meg was little, 
we used to love to make 
 Christmas cookies together. 
Are... are those dongs? 
My God, from October to January 
I don't come up for air. 
All those families enjoying 
 their Christmas dongs. 
Could we get some of your 
 cookies for our wedding? 
Get out of here! 
 This is a family bakery! 
I'm a Christian! 
In the case of Kent and Bradley 
v. Holiday Dongs, 
the court rules that you 
 must give us the recipe. 
-(laughter) 
 -Oh! 
NARRATOR: 
 Under court order, 
 Stewie went on 
to make baked goods 
 for the gay wedding. 
And because of that, 
 he did not get into heaven, 
just like they've 
 always been saying. 
? ? 
(indistinct chatter) 
Chris, be in my selfie! 
I want to make 
 Meg's death about me. 
(camera shutter clicks) 
Hey, Chris, I couldn't 
 help but notice 
how much attention 
 you're getting. 
Want to high-five hug? 
Hell yes. 
Hang in there, brotha. 
I will, brother. 
Chris, here are the keys 
 to the drivers ed car 
to use anytime you want. 
-Wow, cool. 
 -See, everyone? 
If I were using the drivers ed 
 car for my real car, 
I wouldn't have 
 given him the keys. 
That would be a psycho move. 
I wouldn't have a ride home. 
Chris, if you're heading home, 
 can I get a ride? 
(beeping and blipping) 
(patriotic music plays) 
(cheering and whooping) 
-Yeah! 
 -Go, Natalie! 
Wow, Natalie Hallway, 
how did you get 
 so good at bowling? 
Oh, I used to play a lot 
back in Qua... rea. 
Wow, you lived in Korea? 
Yep. 
When I was with the embassy. 
So was that before 
 or after you were 
one of the first black women 
 to do math for NASA? 
Yes. 
Wow, your parents must be 
 so proud of you. 
(phone beeps) 
? ? 
Hey, Griffin, 
 I heard you scored 
with the girls' 
 basketball team yesterday. 
Yep, 12 points 
 and eight rebounds. 
Aw, Griffin, you're the man. 
I got an extra orange at lunch. 
-You want it? 
 -Yeah! 
Life is pretty sweet. 
(phone ringing) 
Hello? 
Hey, Chris. 
(gasps) Meg?! 
Are you alive? 
Yes. I'll explain everything. 
Can you come meet me? 
Okay, still the cemetery? 
Alive?! 
Chris, you already 
 know that part. 
Oh, right. 
So you suddenly got sick 
 of your new, great life? 
No, Chris. 
(groans) I can't believe 
 I'm saying this, but... 
I missed Mom. 
I missed you. 
I missed the whole family. 
I'm glad you're alive, 
 but you should know 
things are different now. 
-Dad finally got a Peloton? 
 -Yeah. 
-Is he using it? 
 -No. 
He mumbled something 
 about the Wi-Fi, 
then ate a whole chicken 
 on the couch, 
-but there's something else. 
 -What is it? 
Let's talk about it in the van. 
Chris?! 
What are you doing?! 
 Let me out! 
Sorry, Meg, but I can't 
 let you come home just yet. 
I'm too popular now. 
-What's the holdup? 
 -What? 
I slapped the van twice. 
Yeah, what was that? 
I thought something 
 flew into the van. 
No, that's, like, 
 the universal signal 
for "move it out." 
I never heard that. 
And I drive vans all the time. 
Well, then how do you know 
 when it's time to head out? 
Somebody yells out 
 "okay" or "all right." 
Every so often it's "yep." 
Well, okay, you're good to go. 
-All right. 
 -(engine starts) 
Ow! Ow! 
What are you doing?! 
Sorry, I got 
 distracted by all this 
whappin' the side 
 of the van business. 
? ? 
Hello? Hello? 
Where is everyone? 
Damn it, Chris, I don't care 
 that you're popular now. 
Let me out of here! 
Well, at least 
 I still have my music. 
Siri, play Seals and Croft. 
? Darling if you want me 
 to be... ? 
(seal barking) 
? Get closer to me. ? 
Good morning, students. 
We are gathered here 
 for two reasons today. 
One, to mourn the loss 
 of Meg Griffin. 
And two, to find the owner 
 of this X-Men water bottle 
someone left in wood shop-- 
 does anyone recognize it? 
BOY: 
 I'll take it! 
That's not what I asked. 
 Anyone? 
I'm not gonna tell you 
 which character's on it, 
you have to be able 
 to tell me the character. 
BOY 2: 
 Wolverine! 
-Are you guessing? 
 -Am I right? 
All right, 
 we'll handle this after. 
But now, here to help you mourn,
 an artist who specializes 
in sensitive music 
 to do finger stuff to, 
Mr. John Mayer! 
It's good to be here. 
I love high school! 
GIRL: 
 Who are you? 
I was born in 2003! 
Then I'm probably your father. 
Ooh, pwned! 
Whoa, looks like the school 
 really is missing Meg. 
Chris, Brian, 
 would you help Peter? 
He's one of those 
 "has to be supported 
by both elbows" mourners. 
I'm gonna need three seats 
 for my elbow supporters. 
Stewie, you look depressed. 
You still upset about Meg? 
No, it's just this gym is sad. 
If you haven't won 
 a championship since 1982, 
just take the banner down. 
? ? 
Well, Meg, 
looks like you really 
 are dead this time. 
They say your life flashes 
 before your eyes when you die. 
I wonder what I'll see. 
(groans) 
Oh, yeah! 
-Over! 
 -(grunts) 
I'm a tomato. 
(all retching) 
MEG: 
 I'm not in any of these! 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Mr. Conway Twitty. 
Oh, come on! 
I was in the Kingsman fight! 
That could've been in there. 
I can do stuff. 
I-I can be a part 
 of a comedy team! 
Look, hey, Chris, 
 who's on first? 
A baseball player. (laughs) 
Well, that's it. 
I'm gonna show them. 
I'm gonna live. 
I'm getting out of here. 
Now let's see, 
 if I whap my forehead 
against this cement floor 
 enough times, 
I think I can 
 create a blood luge 
to slide myself out on. 
This... this... 
can be in the highlight... 
video! 
-(strums) 
 -(cheering and applause) 
Wow, thank you, John Mayer. 
Wasn't he terrific? 
I think we can all agree 
 that John is entitled 
to take whichever student he 
 wishes home with him tonight. 
(scattered clapping) 
And finally, the Quiznos 
across the street 
 has graciously 
taken out a full page ad 
 in the yearbook 
that will feature 
 a dedication page to Meg. 
Quiznos, go ahead and stand up. 
Come on, in the back, 
 you guys have been great. 
-(gasps) 
 -(applause and cheering) 
Oh, my God, 
 oh, my God, everyone! 
He's proposing right here! 
Right in front of everyone! 
Oh, she's so lucky! 
Oh, my God! 
(door slams open) 
I'm alive! I'm alive! 
(all gasp) 
(gasps) Meg! 
Those are dark-soled shoes. 
She's wearing dark-soled shoes 
 on the gym floor! 
Sneakers only in the gym, guys. 
Oh, my God, Meg! 
I'm so glad you're alive! 
What happened? 
He did this! 
Are you saying Chris 
 saved your life? 
This calls for a celebration. 
All right, 
 everyone throw confetti 
and ruin the janitor's weekend. 
(applause and cheering) 
Hey, I'm not gonna 
 make it this weekend. 
Oh, but you're gonna miss 
 the big janitor dance! 
This is our last chance to get 
 laid before Janitor College! 
You think I don't know that?! 
No! Chris kidnapped me 
 so he could stay popular! 
What? Chris would never do that.
Chris? 
It's true, Mom. 
I owe my sister an apology. 
I shouldn't have treated her 
 the way I did. 
And I think 
 if Meg were here today, 
she'd be the first one to agree.
I am here! 
I'm right here! 
Anyway, Meg, wherever you are, 
I'm sorry. 
(applause and cheering) 
Damn it, I'm giving a speech! 
 I want to tell you-- 
Very loud chant! 
 Very loud chant! 
Very loud chant! Very loud 
 chant! 
(sighs) 
Oh, my God, Meg, 
 I'm so glad you're back. 
We love you, honey. 
I love you, too, Mom. 
Yeah, Meg, I'm just really glad 
 this whole ordeal is over. 
STEWIE (over radio): 
Glad this whole ordeal is what? 
-Over. 
 -(audience laughing) 
Come on! 
I'm sorry I faked 
 my own death, Mom. 
It's okay, Meg. 
Actually, I should've known. 
Faking stuff is part 
 of being a woman. 
-Really? 
 -Oh, yeah. 
Women fake a lot of things. 
You faked your death, 
 I fake orgasms and being 
impressed by my husband's 
 accomplishments at work. 
Hey, Lois, guess 
 who got to erase 
the white board 
 in a meeting today? 
Oh, my! 
I think someone's earned himself
Mama Lois' famous 
 egg salad, huh? 
Oh, yum! 
Oh, today just keeps getting 
 better and better! 
Dad, I thought you hated 
 Mom's egg salad. 
Chris, part of being a man 
 is faking things. 
Like orgasms or pretending 
 to like your wife's egg salad. 
And anyway, I give it to that 
 raccoon outside who likes me. 
I thought you hated that guy. 
Part of being a raccoon 
 is faking things. 
Like orgasms 
 or pretending to like people 
who give you egg salad. 
LOIS: 
 Oh, Peter! 
PETER: 
 Oh, Lois! 
RACCOON: 
 Oh, other raccoon!
