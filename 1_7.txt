You know, I'm sick of lookingat that. What? That empty space.
It just reminds me thatCleveland's not here any more.
Yeah, it's just not the samewithout him. I sure wish he...
Hey, guys, look!
It's him! Hey, Cleveland!
Why didn't you tell usyou were back, buddy?
Oh, it's a lamp.
You know, guys,I've been thinking.
We need a new fourth guyfor our group.
We're a man short.Like Statler without Waldorf.
(CHUCKLES) You know, withoutthe other guy yapping in my ear,
these guys aren't half bad.
Now, I know you're interestedin being the fourth guy
in our entourage, Kevin Connolly,
but don't you think you'rea little small? I tell you what.
You can be in our groupif I can have some of your cereal.
Oh, no! They're aftermy Kevin Connolly charms!
How's your friend search going?
(SIGHS) Not great, Lois.What friend search?
We're trying to find a friendto replace Cleveland.
We've been meeting peoplefor three days.
You don't need to look for somebodynew. I'll hang out with you guys.
I don't think that's gonna work out,cos of the whole Quagmire thing.
What Quagmire thing? Oh, you know,just that he hates you.
Quagmire hates me?Hates you. I... I don't get it.
Why...Why wouldn't Quagmire like me?
Because he thinksyou're annoying.
Like people who nevershut up about their kids.
He...He would have been four today.
I still don't understand.
How do you drownin an inch of water? (SOBS)
Well... I guess I don'thave a new sweater and a haircut.
(SIGHS) Who would've thoughtit would be this hardto replace Cleveland?
You know, we've kind of beenignoring the obvious here.
I mean, if you reallybreak it down,
what we need is a black guy.
Yeah, that was the best thingabout Cleveland. Oh, by far.
I sure do miss him.Peter's right.
We gotta find another black guy.
Yeah, cos otherwise we're justa bunch of boring white guys,
like a London gentlemen's club.

Oh, we'd love to, Horace,but there's only three of us.
MAN: Did I hear some sorry ass foolsin need of a motherlovin' fourth?
I'll join your darts game.

Gentlemen,we got us a black man.
(LAUGHTER)
Oh, boy,what a fantastic evening.
Jerome, you are awonderful addition to our group.
Hey, thanks, Peter.I like you guys, too.
What do you say we hit another bar,keep it goin'?
I can't. There's a girl tied upin my basement who needs some food.
That's funny.You funny, pointy man.
Yeah, I...I joke around a lot.
Thanks for the lift home, Jerome.
Hey, if you got time to come in,I'd love you to meet my wife.
I got time forwhatever I want, fool.
My watch don't tell time, I tell it.
Wow, you're cooler thana York Peppermint Pattie.
When I bite into aYork Peppermint Pattie,
I get the sensation...
of being on a frozenmountaintop!
"It has been two monthssince I made the tragic choice
to bite into aYork Peppermint Pattie,
and still I have made no progressfinding my way out of the mountains.
The only food I have is the restof this York Peppermint Pattie,
which unfortunately keeps bringingme back to the top of the mountain.
If anyone finds this,tell my family I love them."
...of being on a frozen mountaintop!
Hey, Lois. I'd like youto meet our new friend...
Jerome?!Loose Lois?
Wha...You guys know each other?
Know each other? Peter,Jerome is an old boyfriend of mine.
What?!(YAWNS) Sorry, I was out of it.
Wait, are we being robbed?
Peter, I know I toldyou about Jerome.
Lois, I would've remembered if youtold me that. I told you, Peter.
I remember exactlywhat we were doing.
(LAUGHTER)
I slept with a black guy.
I hope this doesn'tmake you feel awkward, my man.
It was a long time ago.
Hey, that's a beautiful baby.Mind if I hold him?
Go right ahead.Hey there, little fella.
What's that around your neck?
Well, I say,it's a little black Jesus!
# Black Jesus #
I rode into townon an ass.
Your mama's ass.
# Black Jesus #
It was really goodto see you, Lois.
We should grab a coffeeor something and catch up.
That would be great!It was really nice to see you, too.
Well, it's getting late, Jerome.I'm sure you got stuff to do.
Yeah, I gotta go downto the gas station
and buy a framed paintingof a tiger.
Catch y'all later.
You're not really gonnahang out with him, Lois, are you?
We're just friends, Peter.Don't tell me you're jealous.
Well, you dating that guy?It's just a lot to take in.
(GIGGLES)Oh, you're telling me (!)
Oh, come on!Those kinds of jokes aren't helping.
Well, what do you want me to say?You're being silly.
I mean, Jerome and Idated over 12 inches ago.
(LAUGHS) I said inches!
What did I just say?!I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.OK, look, just relax.
You're my husbandand I love you,
so just put Jeromeout of your head.
Get him out of my lifeis more like it.
Brian, I just foundout Chris Farley died.
Yeah, that happened,like, 12 years ago.
But I just watched Tommy Boyyesterday. He was right there.
Yeah, that's a movie.It's shot beforehand.
It's not happening right now.Really?
But I thought my knockingon the TV glass distracted him,
and that's what made himfall down that hill.
(LAUGHS) Seeing him fall downthat hill put me in a good humour!
Stewie, get lost. What are you doingjust standing out here?
I'm waiting for Quagmireto get his mail.
I'm gonna conveniently stroll by andstrike up a conversation with him
and maybe find out why he hates me.
I'm sure it's justa misunderstanding.You'll smooth it over.
Hey, Quagmire,what a coincidence,
you and me just runninginto each other.
How you doing?Fine.
Oh, taking a break, huh?She's a hot piece of ass.
And from the looks of it, she likesit rough. That's my sister, Brian.
Her boyfriend has beenbeating her mercilessly.
The last thing she'd want right nowis to be objectified. Oh, God.
I'm really sorry.
I got a deaf brother,you wanna make fun of him, too?
(DOOR CLOSES)(BRAKES SCREECH)
MAN: Where is she?!QUAGMIRE: She's not here.
WOMAN: Get out, Jeff!Just get out of here!
MAN: Oh, I'll get outwhen I'm finished.
(PUNCHING, GLASS SHATTERS)WOMAN: No! Ow!
You feel good about yoursex joke earlier, Brian?
He's savagely beating her again.You hear that? Yeah, I'm not deaf.
Oh, what, like my brother?Boy, you have no class!
MAN: Yeah, that's theguy's brother, man! WOMAN: Yeah!
MAN: Shut up, bitch!
Hey, you know what they say.
See a broad, to get that booty,yak 'em.
BOTH: Leg her downand smack 'em, yak 'em!
(LAUGHS)Cold, got to be.
(BOTH LAUGH)Golly!
If you'll excuse me,I'm gonna order me some cheap Cognac
and put it in a fancy glass.
Boy, Jerome is the greatest.We really lucked out.
I don't know, you guys.I'm not so sure about Jerome.
I mean, how do we knowwe can really trust him?
What are you talking about, Peter?Jerome's awesome.
Yeah, why the hell wouldn'twe be able to trust him?
All right, you guys want the truth?Before me and Lois were married,
our new friend used to slip herthe old Pringles can.
Well, so what, Peter? That was20 years ago. That doesn't matter!
Look, Jerome's the coolest guywe've met since Cleveland left.
Yeah, don't do anythingto ruin this, Peter.
You know,the way you ruined my parrot.
I just bought it yesterday.Isn't it beautiful?
Cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple,cripple, cripple, cripple.
Cripple!Damn it!
That son of a bitch.Thinks he can sleep with my wife.
Not on my watch!
"Listen, I don't carethat you're dating Mallory.
Nobody in this familylikes you, Nick."
You just stand your ground,garbage sculpture man.
They'll come to respect you.You bastard.
Nick was no good for her and itbroke Skippy Handelman's heart!
(WINDOW SMASHES)
Dear God and black Jesus!
Jerome? What uh...
What...What the hell are you doing here?
Oh, Peter, somethingterrible's happened.
Somebody burned downJerome's house last night.
This whacked out world.
It just makes you wannagrab your nephew and get in a van
and shoot people in the DC area.
Yeah, well, when I findthe guy who did it,
I'm gonna rip his arms offand do his wife in front of him.
And no-one would blame you.
But, meanwhile, Jerome, you aremore than welcome to stay with us.
What?!Oh, well, thank you, Lois.
Man, I'm so lucky to havereal friends like you and Peter.
Well, I guess you can stay here.But I'll tell you one thing...
Oh, hang on a sec.
What is that? I don't know,it's trying to do something.
Oh... Oh...
Well, I guess we'rejust gonna have to wait.
So, how long is Jeromegonna be staying with us, Dad?
I don't know, Chris, but thesooner he's out of here, the better.
I don't trust him around Loisfor a second.
LOIS: Oh, God, Jerome,that is so good.
Oh, yeah! It's so hot and moist.
Mmm, these scones are delicious.
You are quitethe little baker, Jerome.
Oh, thank God!What's going on in here?!
Relax, Mr Furley. I thoughtwhat you thought, but it's OK.
Well, it sounded like -I know, I know, but it's fine.
Go back to being dead.
Peter, is everything all right?Yeah. Yeah, Lois. Everything's fine.
You guys uh...having a little breakfast?
Yes, and Jerome made scones!Would you like one?
Oh, they're delicious!
I thought maybelater today, we could all...
(COUGHS AND CHOKES)
Oh, my God! Mom's choking!
Out of the way. I'm an EMT.
(CHOKES)
(GRUNTS)
Her airway's jammed.
Come on, now. Just like that.(GRUNTING)
I need some gravitational help.
(CHOKES)
Oh, no, her clothesare constricting! As are mine!
(GRUNTS)
(BOTH GRUNT)
(GASPS AND COUGHS)
Oh, my god! Oh! Thank you, Jerome!
You saved my life!
Um...I'll have what she's having...
says the funniest personin the room.
Hey, what are you gettingall dressed up for?
I'm treating Quagmireto a night out.
Really? I thought he hated you.How'd you convince him to go?
I tricked him.Sent him a phony card.
He thinks he's going on a datewith an old girlfriend.
But instead, you're goingto show up. You got it.
Yikes. That's a recipefor disappointment.
Like walking a floral arrangementthrough an office full of fat women.
Is there a Miss...(EXCITED GASPING)
...es.(ALL SIGH)
Brian? Where's Cheryl Tiegs?Well, she's not coming.
I wrote you that, because I knewyou'd never come if it was me,
but I planned a big nightand we're gonna have a great time.
Brian, Cheryl was the onethat got away.
She was the great love of my life.
I thought this was my chance tofinally achieve some real happiness.
Ever since she left,I've been chasing girls
to fill the hole she madewhen she walked out.
And now I'm forever lost.
Well, I bet a thick, juicy steakcould help fill that hole, huh?
(SOBS)
Aw, come on, it'll be great.
Listen, Glenn,I want us to be friends.
I think we could be an evenbetter team than Lewis and Clark
and the guy who likes torip up maps.
All right, the Northwest Passage.
Hey, can I see that?
Damn it! You ass!Easy, Clark. I hate that guy!
It's been a long trip. You're tired.No! I hate him!
Look, you're angry,you're dehydrated.
Just have some water fromthe canteen and you'll feel better.
(SIGHS) OK.
I just totally drownedthis ant hill.
Hey, when are we gonna get there?
And this is Peter and Iat our wedding.
Aw, you look beautiful.And he's a handsome fella, ain't he?
Well, I am ready for my evening.Oh, my God, Peter!
What the hell?!Peter, what are you doing?
Oh, surely, Jerome, you don'twanna stay in the same house
as a ghostwho carries a torch around.
Ooh, fire ghost! Ooh!
You scared yet? Didn't knowthis place was haunted, did you?
Peter, take that thing off!Hey, what the hell's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
I have had about enoughof you, Jerome.
I know you want my wife,but you can't have her!
You are no longerwelcome in my house!
What you talkin' 'bout, Peter?(GIGGLES)
But you can't have sex with Lois!I want you out of here right now!
I can't believe this.
I thought I founda true friend in you.
I'd never do anythingto hurt you or your family.
Man, you're breaking my heart.Jerome, wait.
He doesn't knowwhat he's talking about.
I'm sorry, Lois. I think it would bebetter if I left.
Peter, I'm sorryif I caused you any trouble.
I won't be bothering you again.
Wow, what just happenedwas kind of sad.
(SINGS FAMILY GUY THEME MOROSELY)
So... Whose leg do you have to humpto get a dry martini around here?
(CHUCKLES)Hmm.
God, look at the sizeof these steak knives.
What are they serving us,Tyrannosaurus rex?
Not likely.
Hey, what if I just drankthis whole bottle of ketchup?
(LAUGHS) Can you imagine?You dare me?
Kind of ruins it for the next personwho might want some ketchup.
So, how's the flying business?Not so great.
The economy's sort of takenits toll.
Lot of salary cuts, lot of layoffs.Yeah? That's pretty much it.
I mean, you wanna learn more,read the papers, go on the Internet.
I... I don't know. Boy, that'sgotta be an interesting job.
I bet you got...How do those things work?
What? Planes? How does a plane work?Yeah.
You want me to sit here andexplain to you how a plane works?
I don't know. Yeah.You wanna maybe just go?
Quagmire, come on,I'm really trying hard here.
Who asked you to try hard?Nobody, but all...
I'm trying to establisha friendship with you.
All I've done is try to be niceto you and you still don't like me.
How can you not like me?
OK, I'll tell you.You are the worst person I know.
You constantly hiton your best friend's wife.
The man pays for your foodand rescued you from certain death,and this is how you repay him?
To add insult to injury,you defecate over his yard.And you're such a sponge.
You pay for nothing. You say,"Oh, I'll get you later."But later never comes.
What really bothers meis you pretend you're this deep guywho loves women for their souls
when all you do is date bimbos.I date women for their bodies,but at least I'm honest about it.
I don't buy them a copy ofCatcher In The Rye
and then lecture them with someseventh grade interpretation
of how Holden Caulfieldis some profound intellectual.He wasn't. He was a spoiled brat!
That's why you like him. He's you.God, you're pretentious!
You delude yourself by thinkingyou're some great writer,even though you're terrible.
I should have known Cheryl Tiegsdidn't write that note.
She would have known there's no 'A'in the word definite.
What I hate most about youis your textbook liberal agenda,how we should "legalise pot, man."
How big business is crushingthe underclass, how homelessnessis the biggest tragedy in America.
What have you done to help?I work down at the soup kitchen,never seen you there.
You wanna help? Grab a ladle!And by the way, driving a Priusdoesn't make you Jesus Christ.
Oh, wait, you don't believe inJesus Christ, or any religion,
because "religion is for idiots".Well, who the hell are youto talk down to anyone?
You failed college twice,which isn't nearly as badas your failure as a father.
How's that son of yoursyou never see? But you know what?
I could forgive all of that, all ofit, if you weren't such a bore.That's the worst of it, Brian.
You're just a big, sad,alcoholic bore.
(EXHALES) Well, see you, Brian.
Thanks for the (BLEEP) steak.
Boy, it sure is nice havingour house to ourselves again, huh?
Lois? Peter, sometimes you justmake me sick to my stomach.
Look, I know you think Jeromewas a good guy, but -
No, he WAS a good guy, Peter.And I'm gonna prove it to you.
And you're gonna feellike a real jackass.
What's that?It's a gift. For you.
You don't deserve it,but if anything,
it's gonna wake you up a little bit.
Jerome got you this as a thank youfor letting him stay here.
It's an actual propfrom Family Ties.
This is... This is oneof Nick's garbage sculptures.
Yeah. Pretty thoughtful, isn't it?
Oh, boy, do I feel like a jackass.
Lois, I'm sorry. I just...
I let my jealousyget the best of me.
Jerome's such a cool guy and I...
I guess I was worried he was coolenough to steal you away from me.
You should knowbetter than that, Peter.
Now, I think you havean apology to make.
Hey, you look likeyou could use a pal.
Oh. Hi, Peter.
Look, I'm sorry about how I acted.It's just...
Lois means everything to me,and when I saw you together, I...
I didn't know what was gonna happen.I...
I just thought you mighttry to mount her
or whatever it is you guys do.
Peter, how could youeven think that?
I would never do anything like thatto you.
You were my boy.We were like family.
Yeah, I know. I messed up bad.
I'm really sorry, Jerome.
We cool, Peter. We cool.
But listen, there issomething I gotta fess up to.
While I was living with y'all,
I had myself lots ofnasty ass sex with Meg.
I don't care about that.
Hey, Brian, how'd it go?Fine.
Wh... Have you been crying?What happened?
It didn't work.He still hates me.
Do you want to know something?That's OK.
You don't need Quagmireto like you.
You only need one person tolike you and that person is you.
And I'll tell yousomething else, I like you.
Thanks.You wanna sleep in my room?
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Good night, Brian.Good night, Stewie.
(LONG FART)
Oh, come on, man.
