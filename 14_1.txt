&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Ugh, look at Miss Tammy.
What a skank.
She's free-muffin itat a baby school.
Hi, Stewie.Mommy's here to pick you up.
Why do you feelthe need to narrate
every little thing you do?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin.
You know, I'veactually been meaning
to talk to youabout Stewie.
I'm concerned that he mighthave an attention problem.
Attention problem?
Yes, he's been a littledifficult to deal with,
and on page two of three in theHow To Be a Teacher manual,
it says that any child
who's being difficultshould be medicated.
What?! Drugging a baby?
Are you sure?
That sounds so serious.
I'm afraid his behavior hasbeen an issue for a while.
He's even been botheringstudents during nap time.
Hey, you up?
Guess whereI have a crayon.
So, I spend, like,$75 on cat toys,
and what does she play with?
A shoelace.That's crazy.
Joe, that's been your answerevery time I tell a story.
It's likeyou're not even listening.
Well, that's 'causeyou interrupted me
when I was tellingyou about Kevin
trying to hang himselfwith an extension cord.
I know, that's crazy.
Hey, y'all want to trysome of our new food?
I'm trying to turn this placeinto a gastropub.
These are Korean tacos, 'causewhatever the hell nowadays.
Ugh! These are terrible!
(laughs)
Quagmire,when it comes to tacos,
I'll trust the Koreans,thank you.
You're nuts. This tastes likeAni DiFranco after a bike ride.
Geez, Quagmire, since when areyou such an expert on food?
For your information,I'm an excellent cook.
(laughs):You? A cook?
Huh. What's your specialty?No-way souffl&#233;?
(laughs) I'm sorry,that was out of line.
I am a good cook,and I'll prove it to you!
Saturday night, youand all your wives are coming
to my place for dinner.
Fine. We'll be there.
Ooh, can we make itSunday?
Saturday, I'm givingJavier Bardem a haircut.
So, what'll it be?Everything.
What do you mean?
Long in the short places,short in the long places.
It should be from boththe future and the past.
Something a childwould do to a doll.
Sorry, I just preferto do number two at home.
Where were we?
It's Stewie,Dr. Hartman.
He's having troublefocusing at school.
Ah, yes. So you're telling meyour baby won't sit still
in a way that's convenientfor his teacher?
Yes.
I'd heard stories,but never thought
I'd see itwith my own eyes.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm goingto write Stewie a prescription
for ADHD medication.
Really? Well,I don't know.
Doesn't that stuffmake you wired?
Well, if you're low-energyand lethargic, yes.
But if you're high energy,
it actually calms you downand helps you focus.
At least that's what I'm readingon WebMD.
Wow, there are a lotof different kinds of medicines.
There's a cat in here.
Okay, I guess wecan give it a try.
Here you go.
Now, who's this little guy?
Wow, when did you learnto cook, Glenn?
Well, as a young man, I found
that a great meal was thequickest way to a woman's heart.
How romantic.
I mean, how do you think NBAplayers get all those chicks?
They're all great cooks.Except Kobe Bryant.
His-his... his secretis different.
Quagmire, you're really good.
You could probablymake money at this.
Yeah, maybe you couldopen a restaurant.
Or maybe get a cooking show.
You know,the 11:30 cooking show
on Channel Fiveneeds a new host.
The old one burned offhis eyebrows,
and was just too weirdto look at.
You should doit, Quagmire!
I'll even come alongand cheer you on!
You'd do that for me?Course I would.
I love cheering people on,like when I go to NASCAR.
(crowd cheering)Go in a circle!
Go in a circle!Go in a circle!
Advertise stuff!Advertise stu...!
Go in a circle!
Hey, where's Stewie?
Oh, he's probablysleeping off his pills.What?
Well, the school saidhe had an attention problem,
so Dr. Hartman gave hima prescription.
You're giving aone-year-old drugs?!
You're doping up a baby!
Peter, are youokay with this?
Will you stop talking?
I'm trying to think about a girlI saw at the gas station.
Stewie?
(slowly):Welcome to Pillow-World, Bri.
Let me get up and greet you.
There we go.
How you doing?
Oh, my God, Stewie,you're totally drugged out!
You know something?
I have been thinking
about how everyone in thisfamily, Brian, does their job.
And they do a prettygood job of it.
God, I'm really freakingout over this audition.
What if I blow it?
Quagmire, when I agreedto come to this,
I didn't know it would requirethis level of emotional support.
You Glenn Quagmire?
I'm Carson, theproducer of the show.
Peter Griffin.I should be at work.
Okay, let's seewhat you've got.
I think you're gonna like this.
Cedar plank salmonwith a maple glaze
and slow-roasted cherry tomatoeson a bed of mesclun greens.
Hmm. Not bad.
Also, the tomatoes can be eyes,and the lettuce can be hair.
Look down.There's also a carrot.
(laughs) This is great!
Terrific foodand a hilarious sidekick?
This! Thisis the show!
What do you mean?
I'm sayingyou're hired!
Just as long as yourfriend joins you.
What do you say, Peter?
I say let's do it!
Whoops. Uh, uh.
Oh, I'm...I'm sorry.
What do I...what-what do I do?
I-I don't...I don't know what to do now.
That was the wrong choice,Peter.
Wow, Quagmire,look at you!
You're a realTV chef!I know.
It might sound silly,but being a chef is something
I've always dreamed about.
I always dream about myhouse filling up with water.
That's crazy. But anyway, thanksfor encouraging me, Peter.
DIRECTOR:All right, places!
We're rollingin three, two, one.
Welcome back toQuagmire's Kitchen.
Now, this mince pieis about ready to go.
Just needs a pinchof cinnamon.
And while we're at it, how aboutwe take the cinnamon challenge?
Okay, Peter, we've all seenthe Internet videos.
We're not doing that.
I was talking aboutsomething else.
I was talking about aserious cooking thing.
Now, the ingredientsof a mince pie are traceable
to the 13th century,
when returning Europeancrusaders brought back
Middle Eastern recipescontaining meats,
fruits and--oh, boy-- spices.
Right here,I'm using cloves.
(coughing)
Of course, most people associatemince pie with Christmas.
(hacking)But I'll be honest.
I'm not afraid ofa summer mince pie.
I remember the first timeI had mince pie.
Our neighbor, Mrs. Morrin,
introduced it to meone afternoon.Oh, God!
I had house-sat for herAah!
while she was visitingher aunt in VernonOh, God.
and she wanted to thank me.
And, oh, boy,what a treat it was.
You done?Yeah.
All right, best twoout of three, cinnamon.
Still on those meds, huh?
Uh, yeah, they, uh...they help me to, um...
uh... think.
Okay, time foran eyes-open nap.
God, look what those pillsare doing to you.
Putting you on that stuffwas a huge mistake.
Like inviting a turtleto a cocktail party.
Hey. Ask me why theycall me a box turtle.
(loud munching)
See, this is howAmerican society treats unique,
enthusiastic children.
Instead of embracingtheir mental gifts,
their first reactionis to shoot them up
with hard-core drugsuntil they're mindless sheeple.
All the betterto send off to Kuwait
and feed the Halliburtonoil machine, right?!
(scoffs):Bush.
Yup. Takes all kinds.
You know, a lot of kidsat my school take ADD pills.
They say if you're lazyand unmotivated,
it makes you super energizedand productive.
Rea... Really? Productive?
Yeah. And college kidstake it all the time
so they can focuson their studies
and drinking alcoholwith their butts.
Focus, huh?
Okay, well, Stewie,
these babies can helpthe garbage disposal focus
because that's wherethey're going.
No need to follow me,
because I just saidwhat I was gonna do.
My God, I can't stop!
The words arejust pouring out of me!
I have more energy than a guywho caught a T-shirt!
(crowd cheering)
My wife can wear this to sleep!
My wife can wear thisto sleep!
Okay, today we're puttingtogether duck breast medallions
with a port wine reduction.
And as I'm walking youthrough the steps,
watch your screen forJunior Chef Peter's pop-up tips:
helpful hints and food factoidsto make your meal a success.
Now, you're gonna want to start
with a large,self-sealing plastic bag.
And in that bag,we'll combine one large,
finely-chopped garlic clove;
one tablespoon of grated,peeled fresh ginger;
two teaspoonsof five-spice powder;
a teaspoon of salt; and a halfteaspoon of fresh ground pepper.
Then you're gonna wantto add the duck breasts,
seal the bag, and refrigeratethat for at least one hour,
or up to 24 hours, if you wantto prepare this ahead of time.
Just make sure you removethe bag from the refrigerator
one hour before cooking.
You're gonna put that in youroven, preheated to 400 degrees.
So we just spoonon the drippings,
and that'll brownthe skin nicely.
If you bang these metal spoonson everything, it's like Stomp.
Look at me! I'm huge in 2002!
Peter...
Nothing like a night at thetheater that ends in a headache!
Damn it, Peter,that's it!
I can't do this show withyou anymore! You're fired!
What?! You can't fire me!
Only Mr. Spacely can fire me.
Griffin...you're fired!
(voice breaking):Okay, that's fair.
(crying)
Peter, canI come in?
Hold on, let me put onmy weird old actress turban.
Yes?
Listen, I saw what happened,but you should know,
we at the stationwould hate to lose you.
You're a big hitwith the viewers.
I will not workwith that man again.
I'm not askingyou to. In fact,
we'd like to offer youyour own cooking show.
Hmm, let me consultwith my lawyer.
Well, Peter, since the DUIshappened so close together,
we don't really havemuch wiggle room here.
I suggest you take the jail timeand just get it over with.
I'll do it.After October 13.
Come on, Rupert.
Wait-wait till you see this.
This is reallysomething special.
Check out how much wateris in the dehumidifier.
Wow!
That was all in the air.
(light clattering)
Brian?
Is that... is that, uh...
Is that, uh... you?
Stewie! Rearrange.
Ewiets. Rearrange.
Wieest. Restore.
Stewie. Hey, come seewhat I've been working on.
I call itSpace Shire Seven.
Nice, nice.
It's like, uh, it's likea fake, uh, place you made?
It's a medieval sci-fi universe,adaptable to TV,
movies, toys, games,and mobile apps!
I threw together a 2,000-pagetreatment last night.
And I just figured,the hell with it,
why not build a scale modeland record voices
for all the characters? Watch.
Well met, stranger.
Arasha deekaba plitcho.
That's a Nebulon Mage.He speaks Ga'bi,
this dumb language I wrote.
It's then... illegal?
What?
Hello?
Okay, now we addthe diced tomatoes.
(thumping dance music,applause in distance)
Just gonna keep going here.
I like to drizzle thesewith a fig balsamic...
(crowd cheers in distance)Damn it.
What the hellis going on over there?!
&#9834; I don't want &#9834;
&#9834; A place to stay... &#9834;
And that's my famous paellathat looks and tastes
just like a pizza bagel.
It's a pizza bagel.
Now, as always,add butter to taste.
Mmm, delicious!
Butter dunk!(buzzer sounds)
(crowd cheering)
Stop it!Stop the show!
What the hellare you doing?
You're just pouringmelted butter onto frozen foods.
You're not a chef.
Oh, really? Then why do Ialready have a restaurant
in Orlando's largestindoor water park?
This is an insult to anyonewho cares about cooking.
Either you leavethe network or I do!
Guys, guys, look, I know howwe can settle this: a cook-off.
Each of youcooks a meal
using a secret ingredient,Iron Chef style.
Will we be allowedto use calculators?
Um, I... I don't...
What?
I say bring it on!
Fine! A cook-off it is.
See you in thekitchen, jerk.
I'll see youin hell, loser.
Bad day to carpool.Yeah.
Okay, Joe, Peter and Iare going head-to-head
in that cookingcompetition,
and they're letting useach use an assistant.
Will you help me out?
Okay, but just promise methere's no reading.
I'm not a strong reader.
What?
I'm not illiterate,I'm just slow.
What are you talking about?
I never tried hard in school'cause I could always run fast.
So you're cool with beingmy chef helper for the big show?
Sure, but I gotto be honest--
if it ain't afish with whiskers,
I don't know whatto do with it.
But if it is?
Then sweetsassy molassey!(chuckles)
Great. Don't talk that waywhen we're on the show.
&#9834; &#9834;
&#9834; You're taking a chance &#9834;
&#9834; Risking it all &#9834;
&#9834; For the thrill of the moment &#9834;
&#9834; Taking a stand &#9834;
&#9834; You ain't gonna fall &#9834;
&#9834; And you've always known it &#9834;
&#9834; They're dying to shake you &#9834;
&#9834; Trying their bestto break you &#9834;
&#9834; And thoughthe going is rough &#9834;
&#9834; You're going home as a hero &#9834;
&#9834; 'Cause there'sthunder in your heart &#9834;
&#9834; Every move is like lightning &#9834;
&#9834; It's the power you feel &#9834;
&#9834; When you get your taste &#9834;
&#9834; Of the glory &#9834;
&#9834; You can light the dark &#9834;
&#9834; When they hearyour heart of thunder. &#9834;
Stewie! Stew-ez Canal.

There's a book fairat the convention center,
and George R.R. Martinwill be there.
Who-Who's that?
Uh, Game of Thrones?Black shirts? Dandruff?
Takes down more nerd chotchthan anyone around?
Okay.
Anyway, I'm gonnashow him my models
and pitch himSpace Shire Seven.
Okay, before we go,I should wet my eyes.
(slow scraping)
There.
&#9834; &#9834;
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker,and we have a fantastic
cooking competition for youtoday with two fantastic chefs.
Really?
You couldn't find anotheradjective for "fantastic"?
Used "fantastic" twice?Who wrote this?
DIRECTOR:Erica did.
Wait, is that the oneI called fat and we can't fire?
Yeah.
Let's get thiscontest started!
Big whoop. I can do that.
(woman screams)
DIRECTOR:Oh, my God, Erica!
You killed Erica!
TOM:Fantastic.
That's him.George R.R. Martin.
God, he must bethe coolest fat guy
in a train conductor's capin the world!
Mr. Martin,I'm Brian Griffin,
and I've got a pitchthat's gonna blow you away.
Are you sitting down?
Almost always.
Then join meon an interstellar crusade
to Space Shire Seven!
Our story begins50,000 fortnights ago,
in the distant galaxyof Warlock's Keep.
Comet Castle falls.
Samson Cyberblood is the newking of the star system.
Long liveSpace Shire Seven,
and long livethe Hyperspeed Throne!
(panting)
So? What do you think?
It was terrible.
Ah, you're speakingthe language
of the Opposite Goblins.
I'm very flattered.
No, it's garbage.
You just took a lot of pills,
mashed together a bunchof sci-fi and fantasy clich&#233;s
and crapped outa 2,000-page turd.
Y-You could tellI was on medication?
Oh, sure. But that stuffdoesn't make you write well,
it just makes youwrite a lot.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go wash the nerdchotch out of my beard.
God. I didn't realize
how those drugs wereruining me creatively.
I haven't been feelingquite right either.
Yesterday, I watched Chrisshower for half an hour
just becauseI thought it was the TV.
He, um...
he lies on his backin there.
Stewie, this drugis ruining us.
We don't need these.
You're right.
These pills are for peoplewith real problems.
But there'snothing wrong with us.
You're just lazy,I'm just excitable;
we're-we're both normal.
Now let's go home.
(grunting)
That man is an imposter!
I am George R.R. Martin!
Whoa!
&#9834; &#9834;
Let's beginthe Channel Five Cook-Off.
Remember, the winnergets to keep his TV show.
And the secret ingredient is...
butter.
Aw, sweet!
No. That'sPeter's specialty.
I was hopingthe secret ingredient
would be popcorn shrimps.
I liked smackingyour butt earlier.
Are the ballsdifferent from the cubes?
God, what do I do?
Joe, check if we have shallots!
Okay. I can't seeanything on the counter,
but I'll do my best.
Aah! Monster brains!
TOM: Looks like Chef Griffinis preparing
a delicious five-coursebutter feast.
Son of a bitch,I never cook with butter.
Joe, grab my recipe bookand find a dish
where I can substituteolive oil with butter.
Joe, come on, hurry!
I told youI'm not a strong reader!
Damn it, Joe,pull it together!
Hey, Quagmire, FYI, I got totake off in, like, ten minutes.
I got a clarinet lesson.
What?! Ugh.
I can't do this.
(sobbing)
Aw, look at Quagmire.
This was his dream.
Time's almost up, Peter.
We're gonna win!
No, we're not.
TOM: And in a stunningturn of events,
Chef Griffinis eating his entire meal.
He'll have nothing to serve.
(buzzer sounds)
(panting)
Well, that's it.If Chef Quagmire
has prepared a dish of any kind,he wins this competition.
Let's see what he has.
A warm packetof tartar sauce
brought infrom somewhere else.
"When are you gonna use that?"Bonnie said.
We have a winner!
(crowd cheering)
Peter, you threwthe cook-off for me?
I couldn't takeyour dream away...
Heart attack!
...from you, buddy.You're the...
Mini stroke!...one with the real...
Heart attack!...talent. You...
Heart attack!...deserve the show...
Regular stroke!...not me.
You're a goodfriend, Peter.
But... I don't wanta show either.
You don't?
Of course not.
I mean, look whatthe show did to us.
It destroyed the mostimportant friendship I have.
JOE:Thanks.
You know what?Let's end this for good.
How?
The same way Paula Deen
got her cooking showtaken off the air.
By saying the one wordyou can't come back from.
What?
Say the word? Right now?
Yeah. Together.
Ready?
You bet.(both inhale)
CLEVELAND: You could havejust quit the show.
