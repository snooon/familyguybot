&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;

TV ANNOUNCER: Today'sfeature presentation of Glory
will not be seen.
What? Aw, I love that movie.
Aw, man, that's gonna leavea big hole in their lineup.
What's gonna fillthe Glory hole?
In place of Glory,we will be showing Shaft,
starring Richard Roundtree.
What? You can't just shoveShaft in the Glory hole.
Yeah, I know. It'dbe better to put in
that movie about the twogirls who meet Nixon.
What's that moviecalled? Dick?
Dick would slide rightinto that Glory hole.
No, no, Dick's too shortfor that Glory hole.
But if you also put inEdward Furlong's movie, Pecker,
you got Pecker and Dickin the Glory hole,
and you got a tight squeeze,but it-it ought to fit.
(grunts)
The hell am I sitting on?
Oh, hey, that'smy old rope toy.
I was wonderingwhere that was.
Ew, what would you wantthat for? It's gross.
No, it's not.It's awesome.
I can suck on itfor the flavor.
I can thrash it around,pretend it's a snake.
Sometimes I justbite it like this.
(growling)Rope!
That's stupid.
I want it.
Well, you can'thave it; it's mine.
Oh, yeah?Not for long it ain't.
(growling)
Come on, Brian,I need this rope
in case I opena nautical-themed restaurant.
Come on down toPete's Crab Shack.
We got boat parts on the wall,
so you know the crabcomes from the ocean.
Eating next to a porthole!What?!
(growling)
(growling)
(toy squeaks)
(growling)
(toy siren wailing)
No, no, no, no, I don'twant to make that trade.
I thought I wantedto make that trade,
but I don't want tomake that trade.
Hey, Chris.Where's your father?
He's still trying to getthat rope away from Brian.
He's got to give upthat obsession.
I don't like whatit's doing to him.
(hissing):Precious.
Wants precious rope.
Peter, enough withthe rope.
Also wants ice cream.
No, Peter, it's too closeto dinnertime.
Get ice cream anyway.
Don't you dare.(hissing)
(normal voice): All right,but I'll be back in a moment
as another movie thing.
(robotic):I am Johnny Five.
Need input.
Input is ice cream.
I need ice cream.
Did I say I'mJohnny Five yet?
You didn't goto work today, did you?
So, still gotthat rope, I see.
Well, I got abetter rope.
That's not a chewing rope.
I know. It's a tying rope!
(car door opens, closes)
(engine starts)
(grunting)
Come on, Brian,you'd better let go.
I told you this is mine!You're never gonna get it!
(growling)
Just give me the rope.Nobody has to get hurt, Brian.
(bicycle bell dings)
Only one person hasto get hurt, Brian.
(growling)
All right, I warned you.
(engine revving)
(tires screeching)
(Brian grunting)
(grunts)
(lisping):My teeth!
Oh! Oh, man!
I'm real sorry aboutyour mouth, Brian.
Damn it, Peter.What were you thinking?
This has to be the stupidestthing you've ever done.
No, Brian. The stupidestthing I ever did
was turn the bubblesoff in a hot tub.
Yeah! Party!
Ew, bath with friends.
Now, remember, Brian's probably
very self-consciousabout how he looks,
so let's try to be supportive.
Brian! Dinner!
(lisping):So, everybody, how was your day?
What's for dinner?I'm starving.
My God, you look likeone of those animals.
You know, theone that...
Which one does the(trumpets) sound?
That... Aw, crap, youknow which one I mean.
Oh, who am I kidding?
You got to take me to thedentist to get my mouth fixed.
Brian, we can try to make youfeel a little less repulsive,
(chuckles):but we're not spending
human money on adeformed animal.
What? Then what am Isupposed to do?
I don't know. But here,you can have this back.
It's boring.It doesn't do anything.
You know what?Go to hell, Peter!
Wow, this isthe craziest meal I've had
since I had lunchat Tommy Sullivan's house.
Very good macaroni andcheese, Mrs. Sullivan.
Thank you, Chris.
That was justawful, Chris.
Terrible.
He is not readyfor flashbacks.
No, he is not.
(lisping):Hey, listen,
thanks for not laying intome like everybody else.
I don't care enough about youto lay into you.
But now that you mention it,
your face looks likea used condom.
Yeah, I know.
(sobbing)
Oh, come on, Brian.
Don't do that.
Don't cry. Be a man.
I'm not crying!
Look, listen, just...here, just take this.
What is this?
That's my dentist.
He'll bill me.I've got an account.
You've got an accountwith a dentist?
He sells me nitrousat wholesale, I bang his wife.
Those both soundlike things for you.
Look, you wanthis number or not?
I won't forget this,Glenn Quagmire.
Don't ever say my namelike that, okay?
And don't tell anybodyabout this.
Now get the hell out of the bar,you pathetic son of a bitch.
Hey, language.My big fat black mom is here.
I know I didn't just hearwhat that man said.
Jerome, you got to goto extra church!
Aw, Mom.
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return toMy Dinner with Andre the Giant.

You may argue that this isa waste of energy,
but to me, it's worth thecomfort because, let's face it,
the world isan abrasive place.
I have maybe hours to live,and you're wasting them.
BRIAN:Hey, I'm, uh...
I'm back from gettingmy new teeth.
Well, come on in, Brian.Let's see them.
All right, here it goes.

Oh, good, you'realready here.
I'm sorry?
Can we ask you a few questions?
Uh... yeah, sure.
Is this a goodneighborhood?
Uh, yeah,it's a great neighborhood.
Lot of families,good parks.
Uh, six fire hydrants,but they are unavailable.
They are previously claimed.
They belong to some badass.
Okay, but do you thinkthis house will hold its value?
I don't see why not.
It's got a nice porch.
And the yard's gotplenty of room for little ones.
Although that's reallyup to the two of you.
(laughter)
Hey, so sorry I'm late.Let me show you the house.
No need to. Your partneralready sold us on it.
Sorry, I-Ididn't realize
they thought I wasa real estate agent.
You are a real estate agent;you just don't know it yet.
What do you mean?
Look at that smile.
You're a born salesman.
You shouldcome work for me.
Huh. Never thoughtI'd be in real estate.
You think Ican handle it?
Every other divorced momat my kid's school is a realtor.
I think you can handle it.
Bonnie, I still don't get whyyou want to see this house.
The foundation istotally out of whack.
I mean, the-the wholehouse is slanting down
to that cliffover there.
Uh-huh. Can you openthe sliding door?
I'll take it.
So tell me again,where's the lake?
Right there.
And where's thesummer camp?
Right over there.
I'll take it.
Now, I am obligatedto disclose
that the previous ownerswere murdered in this house.
(chuckles):Whoa, buddy!
Quit drilling; youalready struck oil.
I just don't know if thisis the right time to buy.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Maybe we should waittill you graduate college.
Thank you, but I'mactually 42 years old.
Uh, that's not credible.
Hello, Doctor?I need a new pair of eyes
because clearlymine aren't seeing straight.
(laughs)
You know what?Maybe I am ready to buy.
Great! I'll get the paperwork.
MAN:Hello? Hello?
What's going on with your eyes?
Oh, uh, nothing.Everything's fine.
Is this the guywho wanted his pulse checked
because he diedand went to heaven?
Uh, yes.
Please stop calling.
This is a very busydoctor's office.
&#9834; Where you from &#9834;
&#9834; You sexy thing &#9834;
&#9834; Sexy thing, you. &#9834;
(music stops)
Brian, five sales this week.You're killing it.
Yeah. And last night,I closed another big deal.
Kim in marketing.
(laughs)What are the specs?
She's a two breast,one ass fixer-upper.
The entire property wascovered in a thick brush.
(all laugh)
Everyone in the officebesides us is garbage.
Wow, Brian, you'redoing great here.
You're really on fire.
Thanks. I guess I shouldstop, drop, and roll.
(chuckling):Whoa.
(laughs)That's enough.
The only thing is, anyonecan sell a nice house,
but a real star is someonewho can sell a dump.
I can sell anything.
Well, we got this crapcondo down by the marina.
We haven't been able tounload it in two years.
You find some sucker to buyit, and I'll make you partner.
All right, sounds good.
It's a plan.
Hey, did I tell you aboutKim in marketing?
You mean my wife Kim?
I'm gonna go sellthat condo.
God, there's got to be a suckerto buy this condo.
Guys, this is on me.
I just hit 20 years in the air,and I got a big bonus.
It's sadwhen planes 'splode.
What?
Yeah, I guess.
Anyway, I am flush.
For the first time in my life,I got money to burn.
Looks like I found my sucker.
(dinging, applause)
Whoa. What?
I didn't know you worked outat this gym, too.
Hey, Brian. Hang on,I'm just finishing a set.
Come on, come on, two more.
Come on, come on,you got to want it.
Nice job.
Let's get you a rubdown.
I'm glad I bumped into youbecause I've been meaning
to give you something.
What's this?
That is the money you loaned me.
Oh. That's pretty cool. Thanks.
You're welcome.
I just wish I could dosomething more for you.
Hmm, I could make you rich.
No, no, no, that's just money.
I'll think of something else.
What're you talkingabout, Brian?
No, no, no, I've said too much.
The one thing they're prettyfirm about at the office
is you don't takethe inside deals
and give them to your friends.
What... What kind of insidedeal are you talking about?
All I can say is...
underpriced waterfront property
that's guaranteedto appreciate in value.
That's all I can say.
Oh, wait, a-are you botheredby sorority noise, though?
I-I don't know, Brian.
I don't know if I'm areal estate investor.
Well, you mightsurprise yourself.
I mean, I didn't think I'd everbe friends with Ice-T.
What are youthinkin' about?
Thinking about puttingblack guy hair in a ponytail.
'Cause the times change,but I don't.
All right, guys,here it is.
Prescott Towers.
Quahog's premier luxuryliving experience.
&#9834; &#9834;
MAN:Nestled somewhere between theocean and your imagination:
Prescott Towers.
Quahog's only luxury residence
catering exclusivelyto the affluent.
WOMAN:Affluent means rich.
MAN:Come live in the kind of place
a Persian guy would sayis a little much.
The ceiling is a pool.The ceiling is a pool.
Quagmire, you got to get this.
I don't know about buyinga place without seeing it first.
Of course not. Iwouldn't expect you to.
But as your friend, I wantedto let you know early
because there's another buyerwho's about to snap it up.
I think he's apilot for Delta.
Delta?
It's not Lew Sheridan,is it?
Well, I'm not reallypermitted to say.
Do you likeLew Sheridan?
I hate Lew Sheridan.
It's Lew Sheridan.That son of a bitch!
Say what you want, but he's gotan eye for real estate. Let me
just give him a call and let himknow he's gonna get the place.
Wait, wait, wait,wait, wait.
Okay. I'll take it.
All right. Youwon't be sorry.
Yeah, that condolooks awesome.
You're makin'a smart move, Quagmire.
Like I did when I wanted toget out of that boring meeting.
Third quarter projectionsindicate our sales
will be down 40%.
Why don't we go throughthe profit-loss statement
line by line fromthe past six quarters,
which will offer us a goodcost analysis comparison
(grunting)that I think we'llbe able to utilize
as we move forwardinto the next fiscal year.Aah!
Hey, guys,I got to leave.
I got a nosebleed,and, uh, I don't work here.
All right, Quagmire,now when you introduce us
to the ladiesby the pool,
I'm a millionaire,Joe's a war hero,
and Clevelandis Magic Johnson.
I own a lotof theaters.
I hope you don't knowmuch else about me.
Is this the right address?
This doesn't looklike the building
from Brian's presentation.
Come on, Quagmire.
Never judge a bookby its cover.
Or a movie.
No.
It's probably nothing,but there's a stain on the rug
in the shape of a little kid.
I don't know ifyou want this now,
but I bought youa mini cactus.
What the hell?This is a dump.
Well, maybe it's stillgot a nice ocean view.
The harbor is poisoned.
Damn it.Brian screwed me.
That's why I've never made anymajor investments with my dog.
What am I gonna do?
I sank my entire bonusinto this place.
Let me see yourcontract, Quagmire.
There's got to bea way out of this.
I'm gonna kill him,that's what I'm gonna do.
ClubAmigos.
That's what we're gonnacall this place.
Here it is. You've got72 hours after closing
to rescind thepurchase. State law.
Thank God. I got to gotell Brian the deal's off.
Oh, there's a headin the freezer.
Ooh, and sherbert.
We're looking forBrian Griffin.
I'm still within 72 hours,and I want
to get out of my contract.
You'd have to speak toMr. Griffin about that.
But I'm sorry, he'snot in the office.
Where the hell is he?
Slow down, Quagmire.
This sounds likea discussion to have
over a cone-shaped cup of water.
Ah.
You can drink from theseand then put 'em on your head
to be a clownfrom an Italian opera.
&#9834; Laughing outside,crying down below &#9834;
&#9834; Pasta, meatballs,Joe DiMaggio &#9834;
&#9834; Fellatio, Pinocchio,a pizza pie from Domino's &#9834;
&#9834; All of this becauseI'm singing in a pointy hat. &#9834;
Look, Mr. Griffin's not here,but if you leave your name,
I'll let him knowyou stopped by.
(quick sigh)Fine. Glenn Quagmire.
Have him call methe minute he gets in.
They're gone.
Well, for the next 72 hours,
I'm gonna be harder to findthan a nice cat.
You need me to clean outyour litter box?
Mittens.
Okay, Rupert, we'regoing to play a game.
I'm gonna be Buffalo Bill,
and you're gonna bea great big fat person.
Close the lid.
Brian? What are you doing?
I'm hiding from Quagmirefor a few more hours.
After that, he won't be ableto pull out of that deal.
Well, if anybody knows howto pull out, it's Quagmire.
&#9834; &#9834;
I have a lot of funup here in my room.
Welcome home.
Aah! Hey-Hey,there, buddy.
There you are. I've beenlooking all over for you.
That's why you've beenhiding from me in this motel?
Now let me out of this dealand give me my money back.
Look, i-if you're not happywith your current property,
we could rollyour money over
into something inSinkhole Estates.
Those places are goingvery fast, though.
Who's a pilot you hate?
You are such a scumbag.
You know, when you were poor,
you were always a douche,
but at least youcame by it honestly.
But now, screwing overthe people who helped you?
I don't know howyou sleep at night.
(sighs)
My God.
You're right.
I'm a jerk.
I'm a selfishand pretentious jerk.
And you'rethe only guy in town
who's ever called me outon my crap.
You know, I used to hate youfor it, but...
now I thinkyou're the only person
who was tryingto be my friend.
No, I think you'remisunderstanding me.
No, I'm serious.
Even though I knowyou never liked me,
you still helped mewhen I really needed it.
That says a lotabout your character.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Because I am noneof the things you are.
You're honest, and direct,and compassionate,
(beeping)and...
that is 72 hours.
Enjoy your craphole, dumbass.
You son of a bitch!
Wow, so I guessthat's it for you
and real estate,huh, Brian?
Yeah, it was a lottougher than I thought.
Oh, yeah, it's real hardbeing a real estate agent.
I mean, you got to beable to count bathrooms.
I once beat a real estate agentin a game of chess.
Me. A well-known buffoon.
Face it, you failed atpeople's safety net job.
Oh, come on, guys.Give me a break, huh?
I've had arough day.
You've hada rough day?
You guys wouldn'tbelieve the day I've had.
First of all, I didn't have anyclean underwear this morning,
so I had to weara bathing suit.
Then I missed the bus,of course.
Then it looked likeit was gonna start to rain.
Luckily, it didn't.
And like thatwasn't enough,
then we hada pop quiz in history.
(grunting)Oh, European history. Americanhistory was last year. Then... </div>\t'
