 ? It seems today 
 that all you see ? 
? Is violence in movies 
 and sex on TV ? 
? But where are those 
 good old-fashioned values ? 
? On which we used to rely? ? 
? Lucky there's a family guy ? 
? Lucky there's a man 
 who positively can do ? 
? All the things that make us ? 
? Laugh and cry ? 
? He's... a... 
 Fam... ily... Guy! ?

Fart joke. 

(sputters) 
Sir, you need to get ready 
for your lifetime achievement 
 award ceremony. 
Thank you, shape-shifting valet.
Remember, sir, I can be 
 any shape you wish. 
Yeah, but you're 
 already this, so... 
(indistinct chatter) 
Excuse me. 
Pardon me. 
Beg your pardon. 
Coming through. 
Nice to see you. 
Thank you for coming. 
(indistinct chatter)

MAN: What if I told you 
 you could accumulate 
all the wealth 
 you'd ever want 
simply by learning 
 the secrets of real estate? 
Oop, wrong room. 
MAN: And then what if 
 you could use that wealth 
to turn yourself 
 into a Broadway star? 
-? ? 
 -(applause) 
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen 
and 14 other genders 
 we have now. 
I'm Lane Bergan, 
the biggest star 
 of May 2020 and on. 
So, if you've only watched TV 
 up until April of 2020, 
my name would be 
 unfamiliar to you. 
Lane Bergan? 
What, did Brett Kingston say no?
When the Dwayne Johnson Center 
 for Confusing Ethnicity 
approached me about 
 hosting this night, 
I said it'd be 
 an honor to bestow upon 
Stewart Gilligan Griffin 
our Lifetime Achievement Award. 
When Stewie invented 
 the Wipeless Dump, 
our rainforests were 
 hanging on by a thread. 
Now, are there too many trees? 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
 Stewart Griffin. 
-? ? 
 -(applause) 
Thank you for this 
 wonderful honor. 
(rattling nearby) 
It's so wonderful to be 
 here with all of you. 
(rattling continues) 
You guys mind stopping 
 for just one minute? 
When I heard I was going 
to be receiving this award, I...
(shattering, rattling) 
I'm not the person 
 who yells at waiters, 
but maybe everyone 
 bussing tables can freeze? 
I-I don't understand 
 why I'm the person 
who has to be saying this, okay?
Okay, I'll never forget 
 the first time I... 
(liquid pouring, 
 ice cubes jiggle) 
Wow, really? 
This award means the world to...
(cork creaking) 
-...me... 
 -(cork pops, liquid pouring) 
-and I want to thank... 
 -(cork pops) 
-(liquid pouring) 
 -everyone who... 
Anybody with 
 a (bleep) bowtie on, 
stop what you're doing, 
 walk into the coatroom, 
and don't come out 
 until I'm done talking! 
(deep breath) 
I-I don't yell at waiters. 
I'm now going 
 to stop mid-sentence 
because I see someone 
 from my... 
Brian? 
? ? 
So, Brian, 
 how's Frank Sinatra, Jr.? 
You two still hanging out? 
No. He died. 
I'll never forget it, 
it was Spiro Agnew's birthday. 
Wow, so you, uh, 
 really went all-in 
with the Japanese screens. 
Yes, I really like 
 changing in silhouette 
while carrying 
 on a conversation. 
Will you excuse me? 
So, how was your flight? 
It was, uh, it was fine. 
I had a layover in Atlanta... 
What are you doing back there? 
Just getting into something 
 more comfortable. 
Can I interest you 
 in a nightcap? 
-I think I've got... 
 -Who is that? 
A little privacy, please! 
What the hell was all that? 
I have a lot of money, Brian. 
But let's continue this while 
 I take a very foggy shower. 
No, Stewie, come on. 
I haven't seen you 
 in almost 50 years. 
And you haven't even 
 told me how great I look. 
You do look great. 
Thanks to me. 
I invented a pill 
 to extend your life. 
It's called "Semper Fido." 
What? Why? 
Aren't you going to say anything
about the cute name I gave it? 
Ha. 
What? Why? 
I snuck it in your food 
 because I wanted you 
to live long enough to see that 
global warming is bull crap. 
Oh, my God, we were 
 so wrong about that. 
If anything, 
 it's way colder now. 
Yes, and now thanks to you, 
we're stuck 
 with President Polar Bear. 
President Polar Bear, 
 is it true 
you ate the presidential seal? 
That was a simple 
 misunderstanding. 
-No further questions. 
-REPORTER: President Polar Bear!
REPORTER 2: 
 President Polar Bear, what did 
 you do for a Klondike bar? 
I believe the president has 
answered all of your questions. 
Here's what I don't understand--
why did you even want me 
 to live this long 
if you were just gonna leave me?
It's not about you, Brian. 
I couldn't take it back there. 
But they were your family, 
 Stewie. 
I guess I'm just 
 not a family guy. 
(canned laughter) 
Mom and Dad always wanted me 
 to be someone I wasn't. 
Stewie Griffin, 
 get in here right now! 
-Yeah? 
 -Well, I just got 
 our Christmas card photos. 
You want to tell me what you're 
doing with your hands here? 
Nothing. 
Exactly, nothing. 
And what does the greeting 
 at the top of the card say? 
"Merry Christmas 
 and a Shocking New Year." 
And what is every 
 other member of the family 
doing with their hands? 
-The shocker. 
 -Right. 
Now, listen, Stewie, 
 I'm a cool dad, all right? 
I could care less what you 
 do with the pink, truly. 
But the stink is where 
 you get the "shocking." 
You get that? 
You get what I'm saying? 
Even if it's just one, 
 that's fine. 
But you got to put 
 something there. 
I-I think it's gonna be fine. 
I'm sure people 
 won't even notice. 
(laughing) 
Oh... 
Anyway, that's why I left. 
Well, that was a long time ago. 
You have to come back. 
Stewie... 
Peter is dying. 
What? 
Oh, my God, that's awful. 
So, you'll come see him? 
Of course. 
You know, he once 
 asked me in the event 
that he was sick 
 to clear his Google history. 
"Peter Griffin search history." 
"Winnie the Pooh, 
"Winnie the Pooh jacket, 
"Winnie the Pooh 
 vintage jacket, 
"Winnie the Pooh 
 letterman jacket, 
"Winnie the Pooh windbreaker, 
"Eeyore jacket, 
"Eeyore vintage jacket, 
"Eeyore letterman jacket, 
lactating pregnant Latinas..." 
Wow. Huge turn there. 
"Piglet pencil erasers." 
Okay, getting back in there. 
"Full cast Winnie 
 the Pooh backpack." 
Oh, "cancer symptoms," yeah. 
"Coughing up blood, 
 pain in abdomen, 
Winnie the Pooh casket." 
Yeah, he is sick. 
You know, while we're here, 
let's take a look 
 at your search history. 
No, Stewie, that's... 
"Spiro Agnew birthday." 
What a weird thing to try 
 to impress me with. 
Okay, first stop, Chris Griffin.
(groans) 
 We have to pick up Chris? 
Yeah, what's the problem? 
Uh, we didn't exactly 
 get along too well. 
Especially after Grandpa died 
and left me the dark boathouse. 
You can still use the boathouse 
on non-vacation Sundays 
 in the spring. 
I've always taken 
 care of you, Chris. 
Taken care of me? 
You're my kid brother, 
 you take care of me? 
Sorry, I came down here to vape.
Send Chris off to do this, 
 send Chris off to do that. 
I'm supposed to be 
 shoveling the driveway. 
I'm your older brother, Stewie, 
and I was stepped over! 
It's the way Grandpa wanted it. 
It ain't the way I wanted it! 
Sounds like you're having 
 a personal conversation. 
I'll put in my earbuds. 
I'm smart! 
Not like everybody says, 
 like dumb. 
I'm smart and I want respect. 
? Funky Cold Medina. ? 
Chris, you live in filth. 
What have you been doing? 
Yeah, I kind of wasted my life, 
except I obsessed over 
 teaching my penis how to talk. 
What? 
CHRIS' PENIS: 
 Who's out there?. 
Settle down, 
 just got some company. 
CHRIS' PENIS: 
 Well, aren't you going 
 to introduce me? 
I'm getting to it, 
 if-if you'll give me a second. 
CHRIS' PENIS: 
 I want to have a look at them. 
Hey, numbskull, that's how we 
 got in trouble the last time. 
(laughs) 
He-he's really very friendly. 
CHRIS' PENIS: 
 Where's the Jamba Juice 
 you were gonna get me? 
Never mind, 
 I'll order it on Postmates. 
No, you won't. 
Stop spending all our money. 
So, what's Meg 
 been up to anyway? 
She runs a small 
 private security business 
out in the desert. 
That sounds kind of cool. 
Well, she basically just 
 tests bulletproof vests. 
(clicking) 
-Ready? 
 -One sec. 
(huffing) 
Yeah, go, go, go. 
-(gunshot) 
 -(Meg exclaims) 
(winces) 
Ooh... yeah. 
(coughs, retches) 
(coughing) 
This one can use another layer. 
Oh, hey, guys. 
Um, are you okay? 
Yeah, I'll be fine. 
CHRIS' PENIS: 
 Hi, Meg. Bring it in. 
Hi, Chris' Penis. 
How are you? 
CHRIS' PENIS: 
 Same spit, different day. 
Wow, look at Quahog. 
Light rail system, 
 gleaming skyscrapers. 
SINGERS (on radio): 
 ? Weenie and the Butt. ? 
But somehow, 
 the same morning DJs. 
SINGERS (on radio): 
 ? Quahog 97 ? 
? FM on the radio ? 
? And the Internet ? 
? And the orb ? 
? A new invention ? 
? Which lets you hear stuff ? 
? Right in your head ? 
? Without a device. ? 
MAN 1: 
 Try turning it off. 
MAN 2: 
 You can't! 
That's not all 
 that hasn't changed. 
Cleveland's still on hold 
 with United Airlines. 
(Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" 
 playing over phone) 
I'm starting to think my call 
 is not important to them. 
RECORDED VOICE: 
 Your call is important to us. 
Thank you for remaining 
 on the line. 
All right, you just bought 
 yourself another year. 
And Seamus is still on hold 
 with Spirit Airlines. 
RECORDED VOICE: 
 We don't give a crap about you,
 but we're the cheapest, 
-so sit there and take it. 
 -Ah, sea turds. 
(knocking on door) 
Mr. Seamus, five minutes 
 to showtime, Mr. Seamus. 
Oh, I want to fly standby 
 to Pittsburgh, 
but I also want to host 
 The Muppet Show. 
(cars honking) 
Look at all this traffic. 
Yeah, Brady Boulevard 
 is tight this time of day. 
You know what? 
 Cut over to Brady on Brady 
and then take the Brady Bridge. 
Is everything in this town 
 named after Tom Brady? 
Oh, no, there's the 
 Rob Gronkowski Library. 
The only book is just a label 
ripped off a Muscle Milk bottle.
And look, there's the 
 Robert Kraft Marina, 
-full of tugboats. 
 -(tugboat horn toots) 
-I heard he had a stroke. 
 -(high-pitched 
 tugboat horn toots) 
I can't even get my bearings. 
I'm gonna ask someone 
 for directions. 
I wouldn't do that. 
 Since you left, 
the New England accent 
 has become incomprehensible. 
I'm sure it's not that bad. 
Excuse me, sir, 
 where is the Quahog Harbor? 
-Cah gabbah? 
 -What? 
I-I just, I just want to know 
 where the Quahog Harbor is. 
Cah gabbah. 
Uh-oh, there's a lot of guys 
in Bruins hats 
 turning around now. 
-Abbah dabbah. 
 -Gwin' dahsee da Sawx. 
 -N'abbah dabbah. 
-Cah gabbah. 
 -Gwin' dahsee da Sawx. 
(overlapping gibberish) 
Aah! Brian, get out of here. 
 Go, go, go! 
WOMAN: 
 Christopher 
 "Irish or Italian name," 
are you causing trouble 
 out there? 
-No, Ma. 
 -Nomah? 
 -Nomah! 
-Nomah! 
 -Nomah! 
 -Nomah! 
What the hell happened 
 to the neighborhood? 
QUAGMIRE: 
 Hey, Stewie. 
Here comes a double scoop 
 of trouble. 
Whoa, you look great, 
 considering your age. 
Yeah, I'm basically 
 exactly the same, 
except I pretty much only talk 
 about ice cream now. 
Oh, that's cool, that's cool. 
Yeah, you know what's cool? 
 Ice cream. 
Want to go get a cup? 
 Cone? Bowl? 
I-I'm just trying 
 to see my folks. 
Man, I love ice cream. 
You know there's three different
ice cream shops in Quahog? 
-They're all good. 
 -What's your favorite? 
They're all good. 
So that's the scoop from here. 
All right, well, 
 good running into you, man. 
Oh, my babies, 
 finally all together again. 
Hello, Mother. 
I mean, uh, 
 damn you, vile woman. 
I must kill you, 
 et cetera, et cetera. 
(canned studio audience 
 laughter, applause) 
-Did Quagmire tell you 
 about the ice cream? 
 -Yes. 
You know, there are three 
 ice cream parlors in town. 
-We know. 
 -They're all good. 
-Yes, he said that. 
 -They're all good. 
Have we already 
 run out of conversation? 
Chris, Meg, how are you? 
-Good, Ma. 
 -How are you? 
Oh, I can't complain. 
 Little hard of hearing, 
which is why I turned on 
 the closed captioning. 
It's about 30 seconds 
 behind, though. 
Wow, that is way behind. 
Now, what would you kids 
 like for dinner? 
-It's 3:15, Ma. 
 -I know, we waited for you. 
Yeah, we-we can go ahead 
 and turn that off. 
How's Dad? 
Your father's 
 had severe diabetes 
ever since they opened 
three ice cream stores in town. 
(weakly): 
 They're all good. 
You can't live like this, 
 the house is falling apart. 
This is awful, 
 and it's all my fault. 
Oh, Pop, I am so sorry 
 I abandoned you all. 
I never should've left home. 
 What can I do? 
Just promise, when I die, 
 that you will help our family. 
I will, I promise. 
This family will never want 
 for anything ever again. 
-That's so generous. 
 -Thank you. 
Chris, your hand. 
All right, 
 now that that's settled, 
let's celebrate 
 with some of the music of now 
with closed captioning. 
? Music of now, music of now ? 
? Music of now, music of now, 
 music of now. ? 
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker, 
delivering the news 
with my Andy Rooney 
 end-of-life eyebrows. 
You won't hear 
 anything I'm saying 
because they're so distracting. 
Now, let's go to Asian reporter 
Tricia Takanawa, 
so we can be shocked at how well
her people age. Tricia? 
Tom, I'm standing here 
 with flawless skin 
next to the shedding, crumbling,
dusty ancient relics 
of white people my age. 
(sneezes) 
Oh, Stewie, you've done so much 
to help our family. 
I can't believe 
 you put in an elevator. 
Yes, and it even has 
 elevator music. 
? Music of now, music of now. ? 
Aw, and thanks for these 
 virtual reality glasses, 
so I can watch porn 
 while talking to the family. 
So what's California 
 like, Stewie? Ugh. 
That was a penis. 
So, do-do you still want to know
about California? 
No, I'm done. 
I have one more dying wish. 
Play the song, but play it slow 
because I am old. 
(slowed down): 
 ? A-well-a everybody's heard ? 
? About the bird... ? 
Family, help me dance. 
? B-bird's a word ? 
? A-well, a bird, 
 bird, bird... ? 
-How long, Peter? 
 -I'll say when. 
? A-well, a bird, bird, bird ? 
? Well-a bird is a word ? 
? A-well, a bird, bird, bird, 
 b-bird's a word ? 
? A-well, a bird, bird, bird ? 
? Well-a bird is a word. ? 
(knocking on door) 
Oh, Dr. Hartman, 
 thank you for coming. 
Actually, I'm Dr. Hartman's son.
Doctor Hartmanson? 
 But I asked for Dr. Hartman. 
His jokes are getting worse, 
 Doctor. 
Is there anything 
 you can do for him? 
Now all we can do is wait. 
Lois... it's time. 
Oh, Peter, 
 I'm gonna miss you so much. 
I see a white light. 
There are others inside of it. 
Adam West, Carrie Fisher, 
Ricardo Montalb?n, 
 Phyllis Diller... 
Heaven is filled 
with every actor who ever died? 
No, this is actually 
 just the ones who did our show 
right before they died. 
 Crazy, right? 
Frank Sinatra Jr., 
 Charles Durning, 
Lauren Bacall, 
 Rodney Dangerfield, 
Roy Scheider, Waylon Jennings, 
Ed Asner by the time 
 this airs certainly... 
Dad, you don't have to do this, 
there are too many. 
Uh-oh, Conway Twitty is here, 
 and he's pissed. 
Wait, he's wearing 
 the Darth Vader helmet. 
(chuckles) Never mind, 
 he was cool with it. 
(sighs) This is it. 
(shuddering breaths) 
Oh, he's trying 
 to say something. 
H-His final words. 
Lactating... 
pregnant... Latinas. 
(gasps) I will, Dad, I promise. 
(all crying) 
No, we won't cry for him, 
 we will celebrate his life. 
The finest cigars for 
the finest family ever to live. 
Oh, Stewie, we love you so much.
And I love you, which is why 
 I must not delay any longer. 
I must get my affairs in order 
and transfer my money 
 to all of you. 
-I will see you all soon. 
 -Oh, thank you, Stewie. 
-We love you. 
 -Thanks. 
(all crying) 
(all laughing) 
We did it. We got him. 
I feel like we're in The Sting, 
that movie from 100 years ago 
 about 150 years ago. 
Great work tricking him, Brian. 
Thanks. Well, you know, 
 I credit my years as a writer. 
When I planned the con, 
 I saw Quahog as a character... 
Okay, that's enough. 
STEWIE: 
 Had a pebble in my shoe. 
Of course I knew 
 the whole thing was a scam. 
They probably did that "crying 
 turning into laughing" thing 
when I left, 
 what a bunch of hacks. 
They're too stupid to notice 
 I snuck into the kitchen 
and turned up the gas 
 before I left. 
Chris should be lighting 
 his cigar right about... 
(grunts) Stewie, help. 
It hurts! Reverse the pill! 
 Let me die! 
Ooh, wish I could, but the pills
were in the house, so, yeah... 
Stewie. Stewie! 
Stewie! 
 Stewie! 
Stewie! Stewie! 
(stammers) Huh? What? 
What the hell is wrong with you?
You've been staring 
at that old man Halloween 
 costume for 30 minutes. 
21 plus commercials, 
 but it's a big decision. 
You know, I've always been 
 afraid of being old, 
but now I think 
 I'll like it just fine. 
Why are you walking so slowly? 
Turns out this costume 
 is about 80% balls, 
and most of it's 
 dragging behind me. 
(squeaking sound) 
-Uhp, we got a tangle. 
 -Uhp, what do I do? 
Stop walking. 
 I'll go back, you go forward. 
-Are you sure? 
 -It's counterintuitive. 
I don't know, that-that 
 doesn't seem right to me. 
-When you want to go left, 
 you go right. 
 -I'm just gonna pull forward. 
-Don't pull, don't pull. 
-I-I think if you come this way,
-and I go that way... 
 -Just stop walking and listen 
 to me. Everybody freeze. 
Okay, let's just 
 think about this. 
(crowd cheering) 
People of Argentina, 
I have heard your cries, 
and I just want to say... 
Meg. Meg! 
I already told you 
 you're not gonna be Evita. 
You're gonna be the back half 
 of Edgar the Farting Horse. 
Now get in. 
(loud fart) 
PETER: 
 Hey. I do the farting.
