&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
MAN (on TV): We now returnto the All in the Family
and Modern Familycrossover episode.
Hello,Mr. Bunker.
We broughtsome hummus.
Oh, yeah, I knewthem two was hummus
the minutethey walked in the door.
Yay! A crossover always bringsout the best in each show!
It certainly doesn't smackof desperation.
The prioritiesare always creative,
and not drivenby marketing or...
Okay, that'senough.
Oh, my God!What is it,Peter?
Look at this. Dennis the Menaceis just shoveling snow.
He's being helpful.
Might as well justcall it Dennis now.
He's not a menace.
Not every stripis gonna be hilarious.
You know something? I coulddo better than these idiots.
I should just go down tothe paper and sell 'em my own.
Well, Peter, you might beunderestimating the difficulty
of writing a comic strip.
As someone who occasionallydates the creative muse,
I can vouch for the unforgivingface of a blank sheet of paper.
In fact, I think it wasWilliam Faulkner who said...
I'm back. I'm published.Check it out.
I call my comicFor Pete's Sake,
because it points out things
that make you shake your headand say, "For Pete's sake."
This one's for tomorrow.
These aregood, Peter.
I like howyou retell tired old gags
with a detached,ironic approach.
Yeah, plus,it's all brand-new jokes
that I'm really,really serious about.
Well, good for you, Peter,
but how did you get publishedso quickly?
Ah, the editor of the paperowed me a favor.
I got him a pictureof Spider-Man.
Why can't anyone get mea picture of the Spider-Man?!
Here you go.
Yeah, I got a whole subredditof superhero thong shots.
Here's your beer, Peter.
Thanks, Jerome.What do I owe you?
Nah, you alreadypaid me... in laughs.
(laughs)
I do a lot of island ones.
Peter, youshould do one
where a baseball playercan't steal second,
'cause he'son probation.
For drug crimes.
Political.
Yeah, you put an islandin there, you're in business.
Hey, how about onewhere you draw a sock,
and it says "Sock it to me,"
or-or maybe draw Loistaking a hot-tub dump,
and she just says whatever?
Peter, your comicin this morning's paper
is really offensive.
(giggling)
That's not funny, Peter.
Ah, you're just notgetting it, Lois.
See, his wife washeddishes for him.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Aha! There you go.
Peter, you should see this.Your dishwasher cartoon
has really outragedthe online community.
What? Gosh, it's notlike the Internet
to go crazy about somethingsmall and stupid.
Peter, you haveto apologize.
What, because of a joke?
Not just a joke, Peter.
A joke that angeredsome bloggers.(sighs)
Well, I guess thisain't the first time
I got in trouble for somethingI said about a woman.
Oh, good.We can steal.
And welcome backto The Flow.
We're talkingto Peter Griffin,
the artist behindFor Pete's Sake,
which has caused outragewith a misogynistic comic.
Here's a videoof some outrage.
(chanting in native language)
ALL:Boo!
Yeah, those boosdon't hurt so much
'cause you spent two minutesof the last segment
applauding a red velvet cake.
AUDIENCE:Ah!
(applause)
And if that's not bad enough,
this morning's cartoonis even worse.
Let's put that up.
(audience booing)
(booing continues)
Mr. Griffin,do you really think
this is anappropriate cartoon
to run on Gloria Steinem'shalf-birthday?
You sound angry.
Did one of yourfriends get engaged?
You have no idea how offensiveyou are to women, do you?
What?! I love women.
I bet I can name moreporn stars than you.
But-but don't tell my wifehow many porn stars I know.
I'll get in alot of trouble.
I know all of'em, though.
There are people
who just started an hourago, and I know 'em.
(angry shouting)
Your cartoon is sexist!
Down with misogyny!
It wasn't even funny, andI have a great sense of humor.
Man, they seem really upset.
I was just tryingto make people laugh.
Dad, I'm worriedthey're gonna hurt us.
No, no,they're angry, Chris,
but they ain'tgonna get violent.
Oh, cool!That brick I ordered.
Wait a minute.I didn't order this brick.
You may be right, Chris.
Peter, this isgetting out of hand.
I don't feel safein my own home.
Maybe we should get outof Quahog for a while.
You know, she's right.
We should get out of towntill this all blows over.
Okay, we'll go,but just give me a minute.
I just want to turn inmy last For Pete's Sake.
I'm like Michael Jordan:
going out on top amid a flurryof gambling rumors.
Peter, where are we?
I don't know.I just woke up, too.
I tied the steeringwheel to my belt.
I figure we've been on theroad about 20% of the time.
Dad, how longuntil we can go back home?
Um, I don't know.
How long do womenhold grudges?
Not very long,I'm guessing.
Oh, Peter, we've beendriving all night.
Pull overto that gas station.
We can use the bathroomand stretch our legs.
You got it, babe.
Did you call me "babe"?
I did.
Oh, Peter.
Ew! Mom!
You'll neverhave this, Meg.
All right, backin the car, kids.
For this leg of thetrip, I was thinking
of driving with my shirtoff like New Mexico trash.
Oh, my God!Our car!
Someone's stealing it.
Ah, crap.
Although, I got to say,
you never get to seesomebody else driving your car.
It's kind of cool.Kind of weird.
We're stuckhere, Peter!
And we don't evenknow where we are.
Well, there's a sign.
(theme from The Simpsons plays)
Huh, guesswe're in a towncalled Springfield.
Springfield, eh?What state?
I can't imaginewe're allowed to say.
Well, this Springfield placeseems nice.
We should visit here again.
I don't know, Lois. Thisseems like a one-shot deal.
Guys, we ain't herefor fun, all right?
We're here to find the police,report our stolen car.
Oh, and don'tdrink the water.
Everybody around here lookslike they have hepatitis.
Dad, I'mstarving.
Can we getsome food?!
Lois, whip out your boob,give the boy his lunch.
Listen tothe man.
Yeah, Lois,listen to the man.
How about wejust go intothat store there?
(bell dings)
Uh, uh, excuse me?
Hello. Welcometo the Kwik-E-Mart.
(applause)
Oh, I am so sorry.Let me unplug that.
Oh, such a nuisance!
Hello, funny-soundingCleveland.
What's the specialtyof the house?
To you, I recommend...the donut.
(magical chiming)
Ooh!
Yum!
Have you guys seriouslynever heard of donuts?
These are madefresh every day.
And then, several dayslater, we receive them
and make them availablefor purchase.
Hey, are these...are these free?
'Cause I forgot to mention, allour money is in our stolen car.
Thank you. Come again.
Sir, we can pay you back forthe donuts when we find our car.
Do you think that I am movedby your sob story?
I come from a countrywhere the words
for "sewage" and "beverage"are the same.
HOMER SIMPSON:I'll pay for their donuts.
Thank you somuch, sir.
For what?I didn't say anything.
Oh.
HOMER:It was me.
How come this convenience storehas so many shadowy parts?
Apu, a dozen donuts forour albino visitors.
Wow! For real?!
No man should be so poorhe cannot pay for a donut.
I was once you.
I couldn't afford donuts.
Tell them what I did, Apu.He stole the donuts.
I stole the donuts.
So, here you go.
12... ten...eight donuts.
That's very niceof you, Mister...?
Simpson. Homer Simpson.
We're the Griffins.
Peter, Lois, Stewie, and then,uh, you know, the others.
Brian, I guess.
Well, enjoyyour... six donuts.
Mmm. Yummy... donut.
That's pretty good,but try it like this.
Mmm. Donut.
Mmm. Donut.
I think you and I aregonna get along just okay.
(cats mewing)
Yeah, all right,we'll be there.
But if you wantto save us a little time,
you can starttracing his body with chalk.
This is thepolice station.
Be careful. I think someof them might be cops.
Oh, hey there.Cool hat, weird nose.
Hey, listen,my car got stolen.
I was hopingyou could help.
Well, we gota procedure
for handling allegedcrimes around here.
Let's see. Uh, didyou contribute
to the policeman's ball?
No.
Oh, that's too bad,'cause he really needs one.
He had an accident last week.
Yeah, I tried to jumpover a parking meter.
Yeah, all right,well, with no contribution,
your report goes rightinto the circular file.
I got to be honest.
I don't usually check this file,
so it might be a whileuntil we find that car of yours.
Uh, Chief, that excuse toleave you asked for is here.
Oh, sorry,I got to take this.
It never ends.
Oh, thank you so much
for putting us upuntil we find our car.
And thank you fornot being a band ofhippie murderers.
And nowthis again.
You bring home two bandsof hippie murderers,
and suddenly,that's all you're about.
Well, what doyou say we havesome lunch?
Where'sBart?
Well, he's atcamp all week.
I'm sorry youwon't get tomeet him.
Got kicked out of camp.
I superglued my counselor'sbutt cheeks together.
That's terrible.
But how did you even get accessto his butt cheeks?
I'm not the only onewho got kicked out of camp.
This is Bart.
Honey, your handsare filthy.
Go wash upfor lunch.
Eat my shorts!
"Eat my shorts."
I love that!Is that a popular expression,
like "what the deuce"?Probably more popular.
Probably... probablyway more popular.
Well, here's my room.
Hey, you want to seemy weapons closet?
You have aweapons closet, too?
&#9834; &#9834;
TODD: Ouch! Jesusheard my mean thought!
A slingshot!It's so simple and pure.
He doesn't need lasersor time machines,
just gum balls and marblesand balls of string.
He's like somethingout of Mark Twain!
Whose real namewas Samuel Clemens.
How... how does that furtherthis conversation?
Hey, you want to makea prank phone call?
Ooh, prank phone call!
(ringing)
Moe's Tavern.Moe speaking.
Uh, yeah, I'm lookingfor a friend,
last name Keebum,first name Lee.
Uh, hang on, I'll check.
Hey, guys, do I gota Lee Keebum?
Come on, look at the stools--is there a Lee Keebum?
Somebody check the rear--I know I got a Lee Keebum.
Then you probably shouldn'tbe handling food.
(laughing loudly)
(laughing over phone)(laughing)
Oh, my God,that's amazing!
That's the coolestthing ever!
Hey, I want to try.Okay.
Moe's Tavern.
Hello, Moe?Your sister's being raped.
Is that... is that one?
So, this is my room.
Please excuse the mess.
(clears throat)There, that's better.
Look at all these trophies!
There must be,like, 20 of them!
23. But I'm sure you havea lot of trophies of your own.
No. I'm not goodat anything.
Oh, Meg, I'm sureyou're good at something.
We just haveto find out what it is.
After all, Nelson Mandela saidit's our obligation to shine.
You mean like myoily face and back?
No. Maybe don't siton my bedspread, please.
But I mean the light within youthat makes you an individual.
Meg, you need to knowthat you matter.
Really? No one's evertold me I mattered before.
That's why youhave to say it.
So say it.I matter.
Louder!
I matter!
PETER (calls):Shut up, Meg! You don't matter!
(squeals, cries)
(bawling)
Hey, couldn't help but noticethere's no seat for me.
Oh. I was under the impressionthat you were a dog.
You're right to havethat reaction, Marge.
Why, I just figured,at home I sit with the family,
so I assumed that...
Have you ever drunkout of a toilet?
I-I don't see what that hasto do with the discussion.
Dogs eat in the kitchen.
Yeah, dogs eatin the kitchen.
Y-You know, you're eatingmostly horse hooves
and tallow, right?You cool with that?
Oh, and the ones thatfall on the floor,
you just eat thoseup, too, huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.
So, is that... is that,like, your thing?
You eat loud?(barking)
I... I'm-I'm sorry,I don't know what...
That's a gutter language.
LOIS:Are you making friendsin there, Brian?
Yep, he's a lotof laughs.
Wow, you work at anuclear power plant?
What's that?I don't know.
Pretty impressive.
I just workat a brewery.
Oh, my God,you get to work with beer?!
Wow! What's beer really like?
Eh, he's got a big head.(giggles)
Hey, you know-- aw,damn it, I don't havea comic strip anymore.
So, still no word from thepolice on your stolen car?
(scoffs) The copshere are a joke.
I bet you and me can findyour car on our own.
You think so?Yeah.
'Cause Homer Simpsonand Peter Griffin
are a great team!
A greater team than...
Than...Uh-huh, keep going.
Than... something else.
Something else?I... don't know what this is.
(sighs) O-Okay,I'll do it.
Homer Simpson and Peter Griffinare an even greater team
than the Air Force!
Hold steady.I got him in my sights.
Whoo-hoo!Yeah-heh-heh!
Yeah, we did it.What's he doing here?
We got to carry him,'cause he can't fly on his own.
We let that other guy try,and look what happened.
No, no, no, no, no, no...!
Wow, they've made a lotof changes to Quahog!
Chris, we'rein a different town.
Oh...
Is that why there wasblood in my stool?
No. That-that soundslike a separate issue.
God, I can't believeI got stuck
taking their stupid dogfor a walk.
Stupid? Well, I don't know,I think he's kind of fun.
What, are you kidding?He doesn't do anything.
You know,it's not his fault, though.
He doesn't know any better.
He's been on a leashhis whole life.
Hey, you know what?Come here, Santa's Stupid Name.
You're a grown dog--start acting like one.
Come here, boy.
&#9834; &#9834;
Hey, stop that dog!
Sorry. We'reon a smoke break.
(loud inhaling)
(loud exhaling)
Nothing beatssmoking and standing.
Although smoking and sittingdoes have its moments.
You always haveto argue with me.
Oh, thank goodness!
I was starting to thinkyou wouldn't show, Dr. Dog.
Boy, you really liketo bleed, huh, guy?
&#9834; &#9834;
(barking)
Hey, there's a dogin the dining area!
How'd that happen?
Get back in there.
(all barking)
Which one is Santa'sLittle Helper?
I don't know.You're the one whosniffed his butt.
Yeah, for, like,a second!
&#9834; &#9834;
Damn it, he's gone.
We're screwed.
(squeaky voice):Welcome to Krusty Burger.May I take your order?
Your voicesounds stupid.
-&#9834; &#9834;-(excited shouts)
Oh, my God,that was great!
I mean, unless youthink it sucked,in which case it sucked.
It was all right, dude.
Yeah, dude.(chuckles)
So, you know, um,I'm only wearing this diaper
as a dare, you know-- it's not,like, an everyday thing.
Hey, loser, I copiedoff your spelling test
and got a D!
Haw-haw!
I say, how long has that boybeen treating you like that?
(groaning): Uh...about 24 years.
Aah!
Just who I waslooking for!
(grunting)
(groans)
Cowabunga.
All right, Peter, if we'regonna find your car,
we got to thinklike a car.
So let's fill upat that gas station.
I feel sick.Keep drinking.
I prepaid 40 bucks!
Homer, maybewe're doing this wrong.
Oh, crap.
Haben Sie Homer undPeter mit Chevron pump?
Okay, I got a great idea howwe're gonna find my stolen car.
We'll throw a car wash--free for stolen cars!
And then when we find it,we'll actually charge the guy!
(horns honking)
Well, none of theseis my car,
but we promisedthese scumbags a show.
(rock intro playing)
&#9834; &#9834;
&#9834; &#9834;
&#9834; Love is like a bomb, baby,come on, get it on &#9834;
&#9834; Livin' like a loverwith a radar phone &#9834;
&#9834; Lookin' like a tramp,like a video vamp &#9834;
&#9834; Demolition woman,can I be your man? &#9834;
&#9834; &#9834;
&#9834; Yeah! &#9834;
&#9834; So come on, take a bottle &#9834;
&#9834; Shake it up &#9834;
&#9834; Break the bubble &#9834;
&#9834; Break it up &#9834;
&#9834; Pour some &#9834;
&#9834; Sugar on me &#9834;
&#9834; Ooh, in the name of love &#9834;
&#9834; Pour some &#9834;
&#9834; Sugar on me &#9834;
&#9834; Come on, fire me up &#9834;
&#9834; Pour your &#9834;
&#9834; Sugar on me &#9834;
&#9834; I can't get enough... &#9834;
Hey, Chief, we couldarrest every singlecar thief in Springfield.
After the show, Lou,
after the show.
(loudly): I don't know!I feel like I'm good at nothing!
Hey, everyone gets downon themselves sometimes.
Those are the daysI'm glad I have my saxophone.
Saxophone?
Yeah. My dadgave it to me.
My dad once gave mea gun to hide.
That's terrible.
Whenever I feelany pain or loneliness,
I just play away the blueson my saxophone.
Huh. I usuallyjust beat up a cat.
Good thing we don't have a cat.
Why don't yougive it a shot?
(dissonant honking)
(expertly playing bluesy melody)
&#9834; &#9834;
Was that good?
It was okay, but it wouldbe a shame to waste
such great butcher's armson a musical instrument.
(shouts, sputtering)
STEWIE:Wakey, wakey.
Good morning.
You and I have quite a dayahead of us.
Oh, that's a clown I painted,so you know I'm truly insane.
(whimpering)You know, Nelson,
I don't doubt that you'vehad a twisted childhood.
Most evil people have.
Hitler, Manson, Jaden Smith.
But you're differentfrom them, aren't you?
Because they're rail-thin,and you're fat.
You're a little piggy,aren't you, Nelson?
In fact, I betyou're hungry right now.
(mumbling)What's that?
I could eat.
Good. Because you're going
to eat... my... shorts.
(muffled shouting)
Homer, you're never goingto believe what we did.
We saw a moviein the afternoon!
Yeah, we sawSurf's Up 2.
Marge covered her eyes everytime the penguins surfed.
It made me nervous.They could drown.
Hey, where'sSanta's Little Helper?
Brian, you took himfor a walk, right?
Uh, yeah, yeah.(chuckles)
More-more like he took mefor a walk.
(chuckles)God, what a...what a fun dog.
He's in the kitchen right now,totally accounted for.
(quietly):Shut up.
I'll, uh... I'll go checkon him right now.
And Chriswill come with me.
But nobody else!
BRIANRuff! Ruff, ruff!
Ah, there he is!
Aw, you like thatbehind the ear, don't you, boy?
Ruff! Ruff, ruff!
Ruff, ruff! I'manother dog in here!
(quietly):What the hell are you doing?
(quietly):He's having adog playdate.
How does that help us?We're creatinga broad story.
Also, Matthew McConaugheyis in here, too!
(&#224; la Matthew McConaughey):"All right, all right,all right."
BRIAN:No, no, he's-he's notreally in here! He's...
We-we thought it was him,but it was just the oven!
(quietly):Now you're just doing voices.
Jack Nicholson?!
Okay, Santa's Little Helpergot all tuckered out
from his playdate, so he wentout back to take a nap
under that tree where nobodyknows quite where it is.
Hey, what happenedto Jack Nicholson
and that other dog?Yep.
Wait, aren't you supposedto be looking for our car?
Didn't find the car, Lois,
but I found a goodtime with a good pal.
Right, Homer? Hey,Quagmire who, right?
Yeah, Quagmire who?
That's an actual question.I don't know who Quagmire is.
Peter, I'm glad you made afriend, but what about our car?
Yeah, I got an ideaabout that.
What's the one surefire wayto find a lost car?
Giant magnet?Giant magnet.
Giant magnet?
(grunting)
Check.
Giant plug?Check.
Giant curbside outlet?
Oh, things never workthe way they do on the box.
Okay, let's get this garbageout of the street.
Oh, dear, I was using that caras pants.
Oh, my God, Dad,it's our car!
That confused old guy must havebeen driving it by mistake.
How many confused old guysyou got in this town?
(groans)
I'm old, so I'm the victim!
Well, Homer, thanksfor helping me get my car back.
And to show my appreciation, Igot a little something for you.
Here you go.Pawtucket Patriot Ale.
The best Quahoghas to offer.
Always keep an emergencysix-pack in my trunk.
Oh, that's cool, bringingoutside beer into my bar.
Down the hatch!
That's pretty good, right?
No.
Huh?It's not good.
This beer tastes exactlylike Duff.
It's just a lousy rip-off.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!It's not a rip-off of Duff.
It may have been inspiredby Duff, but I-I like to think
it goes ina different direction.
No, this is just the sameas Duff, but, like, worse.
Hey, come on, now,this is my favorite beeryou're talking about.
Hell, I work for the company.It's my livelihood.
Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihoodis based on fraud.
Look at this.
Huh?
(gasps)It is Duff.
Your beer isin big trouble!
You can't just slapa new label on something
and call it your own!
Well, maybe Duff should bein trouble for,
you know,not being that great.
(gasps)
Duff is an icon!
Yeah, but some folksprefer Pawtucket Pat.
I mean, don't get me wrong,I-I used to love Duffwhen I was younger,
but I-I haven't even had itin, like, 13 years.
Be that as it may,
I represent the Duff Brewery,and you, sir,
as a representativeof Pawtucket Patriot Ale,
are being sued for intellectualtheft and patent infringement.
Aha! Intellectual theft!
What do you have to sayabout that, Griffin?
D'oh!
(indistinct chatter)(helicopter whirring)
The Pawtucket PatriotBrewery being sued?
It's the largest employerin Quahog, Peter.
A lot of people's jobsare riding on this.
(quietly):Yeah, I got a job for youriding on something.
Peter!
Sorry! Sorry, Lois,I'm-I'm tired
'cause we usually only dothese things for half an hour.
Simpson.
Griffin.
Nice day, isn't it?
A nice day for stabbinga friend in the back.
Yeah, and a nice day forbringing thieves to justice.
We're getting alot of compliments.
Yep, we're doingsomething right.
(indistinct chatter)
Your Honor,citizens of Springfield
and visitors from Quahog,my client, the Duff Brewery,
is the victim of flagrantintellectual theft.
(quietly):I'm whispering in courtto look smart.
But it's not just the main Duffrecipe that's been plagiarized.
Several other Duff variations,packages
and design elementshave been similarly infringed,
resulting again
and again in pale imitations,
cheap copies,clumsy counterfeits
and weak substitutions.
You like sex?Eh.
I don't thinkwe're very similar.
You know why they got ussitting next to each other.
Uh, 'cause we're the twofunniest guys in our towns?
Damn right.
I'm a Jewish clown.
Me, too.
Are you a mayor?Yes, I am.
Are you a "cool" mayor?
I, uh... I liketo think so.
You lived in Springfield?
Yeah, I worked at theKwik-E-Mart, researching a role.
These guys are gonna lose.
I've heard all I need tohear to make a decision.
If you ask me, neither ofthese beers is wholly original.
They're both pale imitationsof my favorite beer, Bud Rock.
PETER:Oh, ho, ho!HOMER: Ooh!
But rendering a verdictis something
I'm paid to yabba-dabba-do!
PETER and HOMER:Eh.
And I find in favor of Duff.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
(phone rings)
Hello?
Uh, hey.
I'm-I'min the wrong Springfield.
So what's goingto happen now?
Well, the Pawtucket Brewerywill be shut down,
so I guess we got to go back toQuahog and find Peter a new job.
Mmm, that's too bad.
Yeah. Anyways, it was still niceto meet you and your family,
even though you kind ofscrewed us over.
Good to have you.
And, hey, next timeyou stay with a family,
maybe you can wear abra some of the time.
Hey, uh, Marge, uh,
listen, there's somethingdifficult that I've been trying
to figure out how totell you, and, um...
it's about, uh,Santa's Little Helper.
What about him?
He's, um...
(barking)
...right there.
You were trying to figure outa way to tell me that?
I overthink thingssometimes.
Oh, and, look,he's with Ed McMahon!
(&#224; la Ed McMahon):Hey-o!
Here's Johnny!
Chris, we're done.
You may be, but..."I'm just getting warmed up!"
That's Al Pacino.
Thanks for beingso cool, Lisa.
I cut your name in my armso I'll always remember you.
(groans)
Meg, I want you to have this.
Your saxophone?
Yes, Meg.When you played the saxophone,
I could feel your soulcoming out.
So I want you to take thisand shine.
Lisa, no one has ever doneanything this nice for me.
You're amazing,and I will never be like you.
I'm not pretty, I'm not smart,I'm not talented.
I have the same shoe sizeas Charles Barkley.
My prom datewas a scarecrow I stole,
and he leftwith someone else.
The inside of my hatsmells so bad I'm not allowed
in most restaurants...Hey, hey!
Shut up, Meg.
No luggage. Car's full.Let's go.
Well, nice knowing you,Stewie.
Same here, Bart.
Hey, I hopeyou don't mind,
I got you alittle present.
Whoa. Is that Nelson?
Stewie, what the deuce?
Yes, I... Oh!Oh, that's nice.
You got that from me.'Cause, you know,
I was starting to worrythis was a one-way thing.
You kidnapped him?
I kidnapped all your enemies.
Nelson, Jimbo, PrincipalSkinner, Sideshow Bob, Apu.
I know Apu's not your enemy,but I just wanted to say,
"I took Apu."(chuckles)
(laughs)That is funny!
But the rest of this?It's messed up, man.
I know! Isn't it awesome?
So, how do you want to keepin touch? Facebook? Twitter?
Late-night phone callslying on our tummies
with our feet up in the air?
Stewie, I don't thinkwe can be friends.
You freak me out.
Bart, if we don't keep in touch,I'll kill myself.
That's what I'm talking about.
Later, dude!
(crying):Later...
dude.
(grunts)(muffled):Haw-haw!
&#9834; &#9834;
Aw.
Hey, Griffin.
Sorry about your job.
I was just stickingup for Duff.
I love Duff.
And Duff loves me.
Duff can keep a secret.
Duff never says no.
Duff is more experimental thanany partner I've ever had.
Anyway, the pointis, I'm sorry.
You know, when I first met you,I thought, hey, I love this guy!
This is the funniest guyI've ever met.
I'm gonna quote this guyto all my friends.
I love his town,I love his family.
But now, I thinkI speak for all of us

I respect you.You, too.
Let's just agreeto stay a half houraway from each other.
With a pile ofgarbage between us.

It sure is nice tobe back in Quahog.
Oh, and thank Godall the commotion aboutDad's comic blew over.
Oh, my God, I had a comic?That's hilarious!
Well, you may not bea cartoonist anymore,
but you are a local herofor defending our beer,
and apparently, that's moreimportant than hating women.
So here you go,a PawtucketPatriot Ale.
What? I don't understand.Ain't the breweryout of business?
We lost a court case.Yes, we lost,
but how are theygonna enforce it?
What, are theygonna come here?
I think we know that'snever gonna happen.
Hey, Stewie, I'm sorry Bartdidn't want to be your friend.
What? No! What areyou talking about?
He was lame.If you ask me,
he kind of soundedlike a girl.Really?
Kind of seemed likeyou idolized him.
And I can understand losinga friend and feeling rejected.
Course you can!You're a loser.
But not me.I'm a lone wolf.
Speaking of which,I'm gonna go howl at the moon.
Don't need nobody.
