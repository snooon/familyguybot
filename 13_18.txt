&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Okay, I call.What do you got?
Boom. Full house, jokersover instruction cards.
I do not enjoyplaying with you.
Everything's so silly.
You guys, you'llnever guess what.
Randy Jackson was justa big sea turtle
in human clothes,we heard.
No, we all just bookeda vacation together
to a private resortin the Bahamas.
Well, that's a lotof my money,
but I used to havesex with you,
so that'sthe trade-off.
Look, it's not asexpensive as it sounds.
We found a great group rateon a discount Web site.
Wow, the Bahamas.
I can't wait to get down thereand dip my fingers in the water.
Yeah, it'll be awesometo nail a hotel masseuse
and then watch NannyMcPhee in the room.
So, when do we leave?
Oh. Sorry, Glenn.
The deal wasfor couples only.
I... I'm afraidyou can't come.
All right, fine.Since you'll all be gone,
I'll just walk around my yardnaked, pee anywhere I want.
I don't care.
I think it's greatthat Peter and Lois
are getting away together.
Yeah, I think Dad's actuallykind of excited about it.
Yes, very. He even boughtsome sort of language tapes,
although I don't thinkhe's using them properly.
MAN: I would liketo hear the specials.
(speaks French)
I would like tohear the specials.
Where is the Eiffel Tower?(speaks French)
I would ratherhear the specials.
(doorbell rings)
I'm sorry I'm late.
I shoved an employee at Wendy'sand they called the cops.
You got to warn somebody beforeyou hand him a square burger.
Thanks again for watching thekids while we're gone, Daddy.
Yeah, but how comeBabs couldn't come?
Oh, she wanted to be here, butshe got hired to be the stuffy
old woman who slowly comesaround to it in a rap video.
I'm so glad the timesare not changing.
&#9834; You a bitch and a hoand a ho and a bitch &#9834;
My garden party has been ruined.
But I'm beginningto tap my foot.
All right, I know most of youhaven't traveled with me,
but get ready to seea lot of airport elevators
you didn't know existed.
Hey, guys. Say, Lois, I-Iknow you said this trip
was couples only,but great news.
We're nowa couple.
Oh. Who's this?
This is Kimmie.I met her in a pop-up window
on the Internet.She was in my area.
Hi. Peter Griffin,all but separated.
Oh, right on.
All right, well,I suppose I could look into
adding you twoto the reservation.
Yeah, you guysshould definitely come.
Yeah, thisis gonna be awesome.
Relax, Peter.
Geez, I haven'tseen you this excited
since you got that lettersent by carrier owl.
Oh, my God. Is this myacceptance to Hogwarts?
No, it's a letterasking you
to stop throwing rocksat my nest.
You hit one of my kids,and now he can't fly right.
Well, fine, then I'll justthrow rocks at the hornets.
He told me to do it.
And thus beganthe Thousand Year War
between the aviansand the insects.
It was a brutal war,it was a bitter war.
And most importantly, it wasa visually spectacular war.
Attack!(all shouting)
Charge!(all shouting)
Sorry, I'm being told thiswould be very expensive
to animate, so instead,here's some stock footage
of an old planetrying to take off.
They didn't have enough wings.
&#9834; &#9834;
Oh, my God, thisplace is gorgeous.
Yeah, I can't wait to puke upa club sandwich in the pool.
Hello, couples.My name is Noel,

Well, say, this is pretty neat.
I brought you kids an old seedpacket I found in my garage.
I know what you gotyour fingers crossed for,
and yes,they're persimmons.
All right, that's it.
Damn it, I tried two thingsthat all kids love:
coffee andold seed packets.
And all any of youcan do is stare
at those Game Boy machines!I'm sick of it!
In fact, for the restof the week, no more screens.
I'm locking those things up.Wait, you what?
Oh, come on,what the hell?Aw...
Aw, but what...?!That's right,
I'm gonna show you kids how tohave fun the old-fashioned way,
like I did whenI was a kid.
But I can't livewithout my laptop.

Credit card information.
And submit.
And I'm a lawyer.
We find the defendantguilty of murder.

After all,this isn't just a vacation,
it's a couplescounseling retreat.
Oh, what the hell?!
Sorry, Peter.
We had to trick you guysor you wouldn't have come.
No. You can'tmake me.
I'll get hit with a coconutso I lose my memory of this.
Aah! I remembereverything!
I was abusedby my dad!
Lois, I can't believeyou tricked us
into coming on a couplescounseling retreat.
I do not likebeing lied to.
Me neither.I mean, wives conspiring
against their husbands.What's next, huh?
Freakin' Cheneyback in the White House?
(exclaims)Hmm, that didn'tlink up.
Trust me, you won'tregret this.
I'll see you all in the morningfor our first session.
Sheesh, couples counseling?
This is the worst thingthat's ever happened to anyone.
Wives, huh?He gets it.
Hey there,buckaroos!
Who's ready forsome old-timey fun?
I thought we could go downto the old swimmin' hole
and swim in a hole.
Ugh.That sounds lame.
Who-whose hole is it?
I'm potentially in.
Grandpa, can I justhave my video games back?
I want to playCall of Duty.
Oh, I've got the originalCall of Duty right here.
It's called jacks.
Got one!
Will I get two?Come get in on this.
Wait, this-this gameis cleaning up toys?
Carter, read the room.They're not into it.
All right,fair enough.
I just don't wantyou kids sitting
around here gluedto your screens.
So let's get the blood pumpingwith my Jack LaLanne record.
(jaunty, light intro plays)
Bend to the left.
Bend to the right.
Get the big spring.
Stretch thebig spring.
Stop to smoke.
Get a big towel.
Put it behindyour neck.
Tuck it inyour shirt.
Looks like boobs.
Put on a wig.
Dance with a man.
Don't tell your wife.
Take it to your grave.
(music stops)
Okay, good workout.
I got to go callsomebody and hang up.
All right, our firstcounseling exercise will be
speaking to each otherwith "I feel" statements.
Lois, please begin.
(sighs) I feelunappreciated,
like you don't wantto spend time with me.
Okay. I feel a numbnessradiating down my left arm.
I feel like you should helpout more around the house.
I feel like salty and sweet.
You got white chocolateFrench fries?
I feel like my cervix hurts.
I feel pride.
Okay, for our next exercise,
let's playThe Oldlywed Game.
(chuckles) Relax,it's just a questionnaire.
(laughs)
Really?
Whatever, I likelikin' things.
Peter, whenis Lois's birthday?

Wow. Okay, Noel.Yikes.
Joe, what is Bonnie'sfavorite food?
Well, she must likeground glass,
because I keepfinding it in my food.
Cleveland...Pass.
Quagmire, what colorare Kimmie's eyes?
Shaved.Sor-sorry, what-what is it?
What's the question?
Okay, last night I did somepersonality assessments
based on yesterday's session,and what I found
was none ofyou couples
are compatible witheach other at all.
No, no, no, that'snot a good thing.
But, interestingly,you have high compatibility
with other peoplein this group.
Oh, my God.That is crazy.
More mac and cheese.Here, just keep it going.
Keep it going... don't beafraid of the burned edges.
Just give me the tray.
Wait, so what happened?
Anyway, I'd liketo do an exercise.
Just for the morning,you'll all be paired
with yourmore compatible match.
And hopefully,you'll bring some lessons back
from that experienceinto your marriages.
Okay, so the newcouple pairings
are as follows:Cleveland and Lois...
Oh, cool! My FICO scorejust went up a hundred points.
...Quagmireand Bonnie,
Joe and Donna,
and Peterand Kimmie.
Yay! I wincouples counseling!
(groans)
Look at thosehairless shins.
They're magnificent.
Decades of blackdress socks
have rendered themsmooth and mirror-like.
Grandpa, what are weeven doing out here?
Looking for shapesin the clouds.
That one lookslike the ThompsonThroat Lozenge girl!
See? She's got the boater onand everything!
I'm bored. Can't wedo something else?
Well, back whenI was your age,
there was nothing betterthan knocking on doors
and throwing paper bagsfull of flour at people.
That's a thing?What, flour facin'?
It's the best thing!We used it to keep Italians
from going to the polls.
Stay home today, Guido!
(laughter)
Yay! Old-fashioned thingsare the best!
(intro to "The Tide Is High"playing)
&#9834; Every girl wants you &#9834;
&#9834; To be her man &#9834;
&#9834; But I'll wait, my dear &#9834;
&#9834; Till it's my turn &#9834;
&#9834; I'm not the kind of girl &#9834;
&#9834; Who gives up just like that &#9834;
&#9834; Oh, no.. . &#9834;
&#9834; The tide is high &#9834;
&#9834; But I'm holding on &#9834;
&#9834; I'm gonna be your &#9834;
&#9834; Number one &#9834;
&#9834; Number &#9834;
&#9834; One &#9834;
&#9834; Number &#9834;
&#9834; One &#9834;
(fading):&#9834; Num... &#9834;
So, this is the second vacationthat I've watched
every Jurassic Park.
Peter, you're awesome.You're so funny.
Hey, Kimmie, I'll pay youa thousand dollars
for one whole handfulof your butt.
For two handfuls,I'll give you my car.
All right,that's enough!
I have had it, Peter!
So, how are the newpairings working out?
Are you all gaininglots of insights?
No! I can see now
that coming herewas a huge mistake!
You're hopeless, Peter!
Your feet look old.
This retreat is over!
Fire up the boat--we're going home!
Mrs. Griffin, please,
I urge you to finishthe program.
No, thank you.
I never should'vecome here.
Or at leastnot with him.
Is there anythingI can do to change...
(gunfire)
(screaming)
Oh, my God!
We're taking thisisland back.
Yeah! Kill the whites!Race war!
(grunts
Run! Everybody run!
(gasps)What the hell is happening?!
Somebody do something!
Look! We got to getthe attention of that plane!
You got to help us!
Man, those nativesare pissed!
This is likea full-blown revolution!
Do you think me throwingfull sodas into the garbage
had anythingto do with this?
Quick!Into the jungle!
What are we gonna do?
Wait a minute-- yesterday,near the north beach,
I saw a smalllanding strip, giggity.
It might be our best chanceto get off, giggity, the island.
Did you really see that,or was it just an excuse
to say "giggity"?I don't know, baby--I'm crazy with the heat.
Take your pants off.
Oh, my God,this is legit ridic.
I got to post this.
(laughs) Josh Radnor'stwitter feed is so funny!
That's impossible.
Geez, coming herewas a bad idea.
Like when I broughtmuseum behavior into my home.
(footsteps echoing)
(echoing footsteps approaching)
Excuse me, we do ask thatyou don't touch anything.
(imitating airplane engine)
I got to say, Carter,you've done a good job.
We'd become slavesto our electronics.
But you know whatwe're doing here?
We're reclaimingour lives.
You're kind of an egghead,aren't you, Brian?
Vroom! Everyone on this planeis wearing a suit.
Say, that reminds me.
Everyone,time to dress for dinner.
Ooh! I want to lightthe candles, Pop-Pop!
Oh, boy,I haven't had this much fun
since I playedwith that Bubl&#233; wrap.
MICHAEL BUBL&#201;-STYLE SINGER (witheach pop): &#9834; I... just... &#9834;
&#9834; Haven't met you yet &#9834;
Oh, cool!
&#9834; Your mom thinks of me &#9834;
&#9834; When she's doing your dad &#9834;
What?
&#9834; Seriously,I drive older woman nuts &#9834;
&#9834; I can make your &#9834;
&#9834; Mom and aunt kiss... &#9834;
This is a very skeevypacking product.
Oh, my God, this is bad.
I know. If we die,what's gonna happen
to my mail?What?
I'm just sayin',how's the post officesupposed to know?
And my DVR!It'll be full in a week!
I record Ellen every day!
I know I shouldn't,but whenever she dances,
I'm like, "Go ahead,girl, it's your world!"
I heard she gay.
Well, it seems likewe're pretty talked out.
Thanks for changing your mindabout drowning me in that river.
(phone rings)
Hey. Did you seethose pictures of me
doing duck lipsby a pool?
I don't know,some island.
Shh!
(rifles cocking)
You rebel scum!
(chuckles)
Ah, you're too young.You don't know.
So, how did you guysget captured?
Quagmire screamswhen he urinates.
How about you?
Cleveland kept stoppingto scratch his back on trees.
Lois don'tdo it right.
Come here, baby.
You need them Lee Press-Ons.
Mmm. There it is.
Mmm.
Oh, Peter!
I was so worriedabout you.
Lois, when we got captured,I said, "You rebel scum,"
and Kimmie didn't get it.(laughs)
That's funny!
From The Star Wars!
Well, just Star Wars.But I missed you, sweetheart!
Why are you doing this?Let us go!
Every year we have to dealwith you American tourists!
Stuffing your slob faces,taking video you'll never watch,
and asking if I'mthe Captain Phillips guy.
I'm not!
Take the couples out,two by two,
and execute them.
Oh, my God!
Well, at least I ain't going outwith a itchy back.
(two gunshots)
Oh, no!This is terrible!
Now, now, maybethey just shot Donna twice.
Bonnie, quick,lock my wheels!
We don't haveto make it easy for 'em!
JOE: Scuffin' up those floorspretty good!
(two gunshots)
Boy, they're reallygoing at Donna.
Any last words?
Moist.
(two gunshots)
Oh, Peter, I'm so sorryI lied to get you to come here.
I should've beenhonest with you.
Please forgive me?I do, Lois.
I know you were justtrying to do something
good for our marriage.
And I'm sorry I've beensuch a jerk about it.
I need you, Lois.
I always will.
And if I got to get shotby ooga-booga people,
I want it to happenwith you.
Oh, Peter.
(both grunt)
I love you so much, Lois.
I love you,too, Peter.
Lois, I thinkyou should know,
I never cared for yourmost recent haircut.
Peter, I've had the samehaircut for 20 years.
We're ready now.
(two gunshots)
Congratulations,Griffins-- you did it!
You've successfullycompleted the program.
What?!What?!
(whooping, cheering)
We just found out, too!The whole thing was staged.
Noel dying,the uprising, all of it.
Oh-ho, that's what theymeant on their Web site:
"Staged RevolutionMarital Counseling."
It all makes sense.
(happy shouts)
Yes, sorry to deceive you all,
but we find that when couplesdon't respond
to traditional counseling,the stress of extreme danger
reminds them of whatmatters most in their lives--
their love for each other.
I feel like Ishould be mad, but...
I guess you're right.
Lois and I havenever felt closer.
And I did getto kill a guy.What?!
Thanks foreverything, Noel.
(slurps)
Well, kids,it's Dyngus Day.
Here are yourpussy willow branches.
Find your sweetieand give her a tap.
Looks like I foundmy sweetie.
Oh, sarsaparilla!
I was going to take sister!
Hey, you little rats.
All right, Lois, let'sjust leave our bags here
and wonder where our clothesare for the next two days.
How was your trip, Father?
We've prepareda song for you.
Nope.
Oh, boy, it's niceto be home.
Sure is, Lois.Now, shush. TV.
Television?How pathetic.
Yeah. Youknow where
the most interestingstuff is, Dad?
The human hat.
TV ANNOUNCER:We now returnto Police Chases...
No, thank you-- we area screen-free family.
...That End in Fire.
(bleep)That's awesome!
(groans)
Nobody look at him,and maybe he'll just leave.
Good job, people.
