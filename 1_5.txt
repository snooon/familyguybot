Hi, Chris, how'd you doon your science test?
I got a D. A D?! That's fantastic!
Just kidding,I know it means you suck.
Come here, you delightful idiot.
Another D, Chris? I'm sorry, Mom,but science is so hard.
Maybe you just needa little extra help.
Dad, would you help mewith my homework?
I gotta tell you, that sounds worsethan a trip to a failing mall.
Kids, your mom's goingto the Cinnabon
that has the cagepulled half-way down,
and I'm going to the stereo store
next to the dead fountainwith garbage in it.
Let's meet here under the glueoutline of the old limited sign.
It doesn't matter anyway.Every time I try to study,
the evil monkey comes outof my closet and scares me.
Oh, for God's sake, Chris,you're in high school now.
Stop talking about that evil monkey!He's not real.
He is, too, real! I can prove it!
You'll have to do a better jobthan you did on your science test.
Or than God didwhen he left the ironon Ellen Barkin's face too long.
Oh, damn. How is it?
We'll put you in the '80s,you'll pass for hot.
Now get in the vanwith Kelly McGillis.
Next stop, Hollywood!
Hee-haw! hee-haw!
TV: Up next,the Hannah Montana marathon.
Yes! And for all you fans,the Miley Cyrus tour
is coming to Quahog Civic Centrefor three nights only.
Call to get your tickets now.
(SCREAMS EXCITEDLY) Oh, my God!Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
But now, cos it just sold out.WHAT?! No, no, no!
I'm calling anyway!
I need Hannah Montana ticketsand I need them now.
Never mind who this is!Can you get them or not?
I guess I should dial somethingfirst.
What's all the noise?What are you watching?
Sorry, but you know the rules.
Hannah can't do the photoshootuntil Miley finishes her homework.
You can't tell Hannah what to do.She's not your daughter.
Wait, so Miley's my daughterbut Hannah isn't?
Right. Great.
Put your wig on. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)Shut up!
This is real.
Ha! You're watching Hannah Montana?
Well, yeah...to make fun of it.
I mean, look how stupid she iswith her clothes and her makeup...
and...and...and...thatfabulous hair and...
Oh, my God, Brian, it's my favouriteshow! It's my favourite show ever!
Gay. And she's coming to townand I have to get tickets, Brian.
You have to help me get tickets!No. It's a stupid show
and a huge waste of time.
But...she's my favourite.
Oh, my God, are you...crying?
Yes! Hannah Montana is my hero!
I love her so, so much. This is theonly time she's gonna be in town
and now I'll never get to see her!
Will you help me?(SIGHS) All right, fine.
Hey, Chris, you wanna practisekissing again?
I'm busy. I set up a video cameralast night
so I can prove to Mom and Dadthat the evil monkey is real,
and I wanna see what I got.
Huh, nothing.
All right, it's time to play rough!
I got you, you bastard!
Well, here he is!
The evil monkey.
Do you believe me now?! Holy crap!
It is real! Oh, my God!I thought I was the only one!
Meg, we're doing...We're doing Chris' monkey.
Oh, my God! Chris was right!
Holy crap! Chris,is that thing dangerous?
Yes, he's evil!
I'm not really evil.(GASPS) It talks!
If someone will please untie me,I'll explain everything.
No, Dad, don't do it! He's evil!
Look, just trust me.This is all a huge misunderstanding.
Chris, I think we should give hima chance to explain himself. No!
Thank you very much.Now, I know this looks bad,
me living in your son's closetand all,
but it's a very complex situation.
You see, basically,I got home from work one day
and found my wife cheating on mewith another monkey.
Oh, that's terrible!
I fell into a deep depressionafter the divorce,
which ended up costing me my job.
All my money was gone,which means I lost the house.
So I moved into Chris' closet justuntil I got back on my feet again.
Wound up living therefor nine years.
Oh, my God! You've missed so much!
Like when America was attacked bymentally challenged suicide bombers.
Allahu Akbar!
You know something? You're not evilat all, are you?
No, he's not. He's just a poorfellow who's down on his luck.
Easy for you to say!
He doesn't hide in your closetmaking a scary face!
That's the face I makewhen I'm thinking.
You're always pointing at me! I wastrying to start a conversation.
You do that weird trembling thing!I have a copper deficiency.
Look, Chris, I'm sorryif I scared you before,
but this is a great chancefor us to start over! No, it isn't!
You can fool everyone else,but you can't fool me.
You go to hell!
(GASPS)
OK, remember to play it cool.Act like you belong here.
Oh, my God! I love you. I'm yourbiggest fan. Can I touch your hair?!
(SCREAMS) Who are you guys?How did you get back here?
Look, I'm really sorry about this.This is my friend Stewie.
He's just a babyand he's your biggest fan and...
He has cancer. Oh, my God. Really?
Yeah, he's got a tumour in his headthe size of a football.
I think I can see it! Well,in that case, I wouldn't feel right
about throwing you out,especially if you're my biggest fan.
(SHUDDERS IN DELIGHT)
Sarah Silverman is one of the mostwonderful people you'll ever meet.
That is just so good to hear.I want to like her.
She is so funny.I want her to also be nice.
Well, I'm glad you guysare having such a great time
with that evil thingthat tortured me for years (!)
Dad, I thought you were gonnahelp me with my book report.
Chris, there is a monkey here.
And I just fed him a whole bagof Subway sandwiches.
In a couple hours,we are going to sit around
and throw his soft bread stoolat each other.
Now, you are welcome tobe a part of that...or not.
I'm just telling youwhat's gonna happen.
Well, thanks for nothing, Dad!
Don't mind him, Monkey,he's just a big disappointment.
Like things that look like DVDsfrom far away.
(GASPS) DVDs! Aw, books.
Oh, that feels so good!You are an artist. Thank you!
Lois doesn't like my toenailscos they stab her in the night.
Hear that, Lois?Somebody likes my toenails.
Good for you, Peter.Good for this family.
Good for all of us.
Mom, Dad, I got an Aon my book report!
That's wonderful, honey!Congratulations, Chris.
What did you write about? I...um...
The slave trade allegoryof Curious George?
Wait a minute, I didn't write this.Oh, really?
Did... Did you write this?!
Well, I can't take all the credit.
I've been listening to you talkin your sleep for years
so I just put your thoughtson paper, that's all. Wow.
That's the nicest thinganyone's ever done for me.
Thanks, Evil Monk- Thanks, Monkey.
Aw. I'd get up to hug you,
but sitting down's the only thingkeeping the poop in. That's OK.
I can't believe I'm sitting herewith you, Miley Cyrus.
It's like I'm in a dream.That makes me happy, Stewie.
What are you doing? Oh, I'm justwriting some new lyrics.
Oh, you write your own lyrics? Yeah.
So do I...
Oh, you wrote a song?
Look at you! You're a regular littleTim McGraw!
(LAUGHS)
I'm a little better than Tim McGraw.
Hey, these are pretty good, Stewie!Really?!
Do you think you could sing them?Only if you sing with me!
(SQUEALS GIDDILY)
# You and I didn't quite get alongwhen we first met
# When you put us togetherwe just didn't blend
# But the more that I know youthe more it's a good fit
# Now we've got what it takesto be very best friends
# Friendship is the best thing ever
# Except for best friendship,which is a little better

# Now we're friends# Yes, it's true
# That no-one else can friend melike you
# Friendship is the best thing ever

Hey, where you guys been?
We went to the father-son barbecue.
You drove all the way upto Fatherson for a barbecue?
No, Dad, it was a barbecuefor fathers and sons.
Wait a minute. You went with themonkey to a father-son thing?
Well, it's not like youever take me anywhere.
What?! Listen, Peter, I didn't -Meg, please.
It's true! You never want to doanything with me.
But the monkey's been taking meto all the fun places I like,
and he's been helping mewith all my homework!
He helped me get an A in algebra.
How did the monkey knowyou needed help with algebra?
Because he asked!
That's right, Dad, you never ask.
Even if you did, you never listen!
And now you're getting madat the monkey cos he actually cares?
Screw you!
You are the worst dad in the worldand I hate you!
Well... Well, I hate you too!
Ah, damn. I left my cell phoneup at that monkey-kid barbecue.
I thought you saidit was a father-son barbecue.
Yeah, but it was up in Monkeykid.WHAT?!
Boy, you guys have been awful quietthis morning.
Lois, could you ask Christo pass the maple syrup?
Meg, could you tell Dad thathe's too fat to need extra syrup?
Lois, could you tell Christhat I'm sorry
I ever planted the seed versionof him in your vagina?
I want you two to stop this. This isno way for a father and son to act.
According to him,that stupid monkey'smore of a father to him than I am.
Me makes time for meand you never do!
You're supposed to love me,and all you do is hurt me!
This morning I had a hard poothat hurt, but then it felt great!
Meg, I'm trying to be mad right nowbut that's making me want to smile.
(GIGGLES) This'll get Chris.
Hey, classmates.Griffin, did you gain weight?
That's not important.But you know what is important?
I'm gay now. Let's all of usgo be gay somewhere together.
Then go and tell your friends that Iwelcome them to be gay with me too.
Because I am gay.
I'll be gay with you.Oh, this is too perfect.
Chris is gonna be so gayby the end of this.
What's this? (READS SIGN)
Well, that's a no-brainer.
Come on, you fat (BLEEP). Do it.
(SCREAMS) (LAUGHS)
Who's laughing now?
I got my hat.
Hey, guys! I stopped at Pinkberryand I got some for everybody.
Wow, thanks! You're welcome.
I gotta go put on my facefor press interviews.
Stewie, can you hand memy cell phone? Oh, sure.
(CRACKLING) Thanks.
That was weird. Did you hear that,when I was giving her the phone? No.
It was like...interferenceor something.
Wait a second!
(BOTH GASP)
Oh, my God! She's an android!
Miley Cyrus is an android!
Of course! She's a productof Disney Imagineering.
They built a perfect robotteen idol!
Yes, assuringthat she could never fail!
Like famous duelist Sir HenryGiant-hole-in-the-torso Wickenshire.
Aha! Right through me!
Prepare for returned fire,Sir Joseph Broadfront!
I give you one last chanceto rescind your insult
of calling me a common dandy.
Never!
(MUSIC)
My God, I can't believeshe's an android!
Do you think we should tell someoneor do something?
Well, we could do something.Like what?
Well, look at her. She dances likea real girl, moves like a real girl.
Yeah? Do you think she...doesother stuff like a real girl?
You know, if you reprogrammed her.
Brian, that's sick! She's 16!
I'm eight. All right,I'll see what I can do.
Hey, Miley! Oh, hi, Stewie.
Hey, your shirt tag is showing,let me just...
There we go, all done.
Um...
MILEY SMASH!
(ROARS)
Uh-oh. Hang on,maybe I can fix this.
Run!
Monkey, do you thinkyou could help me?
I can't stand Peter and Chris beingat each other's throats anymore.
Of course, Lois. If we can get themin the same room together,
I can convince them to talk it out.Why don't you invite Peter to lunch,
I'll invite Chris,and we'll see what we can do?
Oh, thank you.I'd really appreciate it.
What the hell are you doing here?I thought I was meeting Lois.
She wanted me to talk to you guysabout the way you've been behaving.
Look, Chris is being a jerk.
There's nothing you can saythat will make me change my mind.
Peter, you're acting bananas.(GIGGLES) All right, I'll listen.
You're both good guys,and that's why it's important
for you to reconcileyour differences.
Chris, I know you're angry,but do you really hate your father?
No, I just think he's a douche.Sometimes he is.
And, Peter, do you reallyhate your son?
No. But sometimeshe's such a little fat jerk!
It's only because you neverhave any time for me!
Peter, do you think you could makea little more time for your son?
Yeah, I guess so.
(SCREAMING)
The hell was that about?Was that Stewie and Brian?
(ROAR)
(SCREAMING)
(ROARS)
(ROARS)
(GASPS) It's Miley Cyrus!And she's destroying the city!
Oh, my God!
Miss Cyrus, I ask you to stopwhat you're doing.
I don't just mean this,I mean everything.
The show, the music,it's all just awful.
(ROARS)
(YELPS)
Dad, we've gotta help him!Do something!
What am I supposed to do?You're my dad! Think of something!
Quagmire, fire up the biplane.
My son needs my help.
(ROARS)
All right, we're closing in.Get ready to fire.
(MIMICKS MACHINE GUN)
Giggity-giggity-giggity-giggity.
(SCREAMS)
(ROARS)
(ROARS)
Monkey, grab my hand!
(SCREAMS)
Well, the airplane got her.
Oh, no, it wasn't the airplane.
'Twas beauty killed the beast.
You know, Brian, here's your shot.Go for it.
Oh, too late.
No, it's not.
Thanks for everything, Monkey.
You made me realise how muchChris really means to me and...
And how I should always remembernot to take him for granted.
Well, sometimes all anybody needsis a little bit of a wake-up call.
Now that you two are getting alongagain, my work here is done.
Guess I'll be moving on now.
You have to leave?
I thought you were gonna go backto living in my closet again.
I think that time of my lifeis over, Chris.
But I'll always remember you.
But...where will you go?
I'll go where I'm needed.
Dad, there's an evil monkeyin my closet!
TOM TUCKER: I don't care, son.I just do not care.
