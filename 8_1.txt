Step right up!Step right up!
You won't believe your eyes!
Step right up and see theamazing half man, half clam!
What a rip-off.
It's just kim cattrallsitting indian-style.
Boy, they've got somevery unusual prizes
At the carnival this year.
A winner!
Congratulations, son.
You've won a genuinelive homosexual!
Ooh, whereare we going?!
Wait, don't tell me.
Oh, boy!Mom, can I keep him?
Well, it's a bigresponsibility, chris.
That means you'll haveto clean up afterhim and feed him.
What do you eat?
Attention.
I like your hair.
Still hungry.
You have a beautifulspeaking voice.
I'm full.
Let's see.
I guess 185 pounds.
Wrong.
I'm 95% helium.
Brian, look what I won!
Wow, what'dyou win that for?
For having the best pigin the competition.
Wait, you bred a pig?Sure did.
Most genetically-perfectone in the contest.
Oink.
Oh, my god!
Yes, he's something,isn't he?
Are those fists?
Damn right.Show him, pig.
How the hell did you do this?
I'll let you in ona little secret, brian.
I didn't do it.I got it from a farm.
What the hell kind of farmbreeds pigs like this?
Would you like to see itfor yourself, brian?
Yeah, I would.
Good, 'cause it's gonnablow your mind
Like the stereopticon didto americans in 1910.
Hey, I'm in new york city!
No, I'm not!Yes, I am!
No, I'm not! Yes, I am!
What's going on here?!
(beeping)
This is it, brian.
What's that?
It's how I got the pig.
You ever heardof the multiversetheory, brian?
Well, of course I have,
But I'm wonderingif you have.
Oh, my god.So transparent.
Well, the theory states
That there arean infinite number of universes
Coexisting with ourson parallel dimensional planes.
Dimensionalplanes, right.
Don't, don't do that.
Don't, don't repeatthe last two words
Like you already kinda knewwhat I was talkin' about.
You have no ideawhat I'm talkin' about.
Now in each of thesealternate universes,
The reality is differentthan our own.
Sometimes only slightly,sometimes quite radically.
The point is, every possibleeventuality exists.
And that's whereyou got the pig,
In a parallel universe.
Prepare yourself, brian,and I'll show you.
Where are we?
This is quahog, brian.Same year, same time.
But in this universe,
Christianity never existed,which means the dark ages
Of scientific repressionnever occurred, and thus,
Humanity is a thousand yearsmore advanced.
Ergo, muscular,genetically perfect pigs.
Hey, look,there's quagmire.
Thanks, honey.Say hi to your husband.
(device beeping)
Oh, I got aids again.
Better take my"nyquil cold, flu and aids."
All gone.
What time do you supposeit is, brian?
I don't know,about 3:30.
Watch the sidewalk.
&#9834; drop dead legs &#9834;
&#9834; pretty smile &#9834;
&#9834; hurts my head, gets me wild &#9834;
&#9834; dig that steam... &#9834;
My god,is that... Meg?!
36d, brian.
And you knowwhat's amazing?
In this universe,
She's still oneof the ugly ones.
If you saw lois,
You'd have to putyour penis in a wheelchair.
Come on.I'll show you around.
Hey, is there abathroom around here?
Oh, you needto go pee or poop?
Poop.One poop removal.
(electronic twittering)
Wow, did I just go poop?
You sure did.All digital.
Where does it go?
It gets beamedto another dimension.
Let me ask you this:
What about all therenaissance art thatchristianity inspired?
That wasmy first question, too.
Come on, have a lookat the sistine chapel.
Wow.
Yeah, with no christianityto inspire michelangelo,
They gave the jobto john hinckley.
All right, you readyto go home now?
Are you kidding?This is amazing.
Can we see moreuniverses?
Hmm. Well, I haven'ttried yet,
But I don't see why not.
Whoa, what's this place?
Yeah, this universelooks weird.
Yeah, it's cheapand somehow lazy.
Peter:Yabba-dabba... (giggles)
Rockpeter?
(audience laughteron laugh track)
Yes, rocklois?
That was wonderful rock sexwe had last rock night.
(laughter)
Yes, I enjoyed rocking you upthe rock last night.
(laughter)
I know. I'm glad you worethat rock ring.
(laughter)
But we still always usea rockphylactic.
I'm ribbited for your pleasure.
Hey, brian, want to getthe rock out of here?
Rock yeah.
Huh. This looks likespooner street,
Only something'snot quite right.
Accordingto the multiverse guide,
This is a universewhere the United States
Never droppedthe atomic bomb on hiroshima,
So the japanesejust never quit.
(farts)
(giggles)
Well, I thinkI've seen enough.
Let's get backto our universe.
All right, off we go.
Ah, home, sweet home.
Lois (happy):Peter?
(sad):Peter?
(happy):What?
(sad):What?
(happy):Can you take outthe trash?
(sad):'cause it stinksin the kitchen.
(happy):Sure thing, lois, delighted to.
(sad): I get tiredwhen I stand.
(both gasp)
What the hell is this?
This isn't our universe.
Apparently, this isa universe
Where everyone has two heads:One happy, one sad.
Honey, have youseen stewie?
I can't findhim anywhere.
I sure have!
He's over there,playing in the corner.
(happy): I want youto know I love you.
(sad): I'm trying to getexcited about it.
Oh, this is too freaky.
Why didn't thatthing take us home?
I don't know.I told you,
It hasn't beenfully tested yet.
Well, we can't stay here,that's for sure.
(happy):And now back to channel 5 newsat 6:00.
(sad):Quahog's lowest-rated newscast.
The president's dogjust had puppies!
There was a plane crash.
Stewie, please tell meyou know how to get us home.
Of course I knowhow to get us home.
What the hell?Stewie, what's going on?
Well, from the lookof it,
I'm guessing this is quahog,but during some sort of ice age.
Well, press the button.Get us outta here.
Uh-oh, I can't reachthe device.
What?You're kidding.
Yeah, get comfortable.
I think we're gonna be herefor a while.
Oh, look, there's your poopfrom the other universe.
Stewie, you gottaget us out of here!
If we stay inhere much longer,
We're either gonnafreeze or starve!
I know, but I can't reachthe device.
You try.You're closer to it,
And besides,you're stronger than I am.
Hey, what was that?
Oh, well, you saidI was stronger than you,
And that must havemade me happy.
So my tailstarted wagging.
Looks like it carvedthrough the ice a bit.
Yeah, it did.Keep going.
Okay, uh, let's see, um...
You want to gofor a walk?
It's working!Do more!
Uh, you want a treat?!You want a treat, boy?!
That's good,that's good, but you...
You really haveone, right?!Oh, yeah, yeah.
And we're goingfor that walk?!
Oh, yeah, definitely.And, um, I'll, I'llgive you a bath!
No, no, no!Oh, sorry, sorry.
And, and I'll,I'll let you gofor a ride in the car!
Oh, you betternot be lying!
You want to sleepin the bed with us?!
Yes! Oh, I never get to!
It must be aspecial occasion!
You got it!You're through!
Yes! All right,what do I do?
Just pressthe red button!
Okay.Uh, which one's red?
Press the big button!
This can't be it.
This doesn'tlook familiar.
You're right, brian.
Apparently, this isa universe
Where everyone hasto take a poopright just now.
Okay, uh, bill, you gotthose numbers?Yeah, yeah.
Okay, just leavethem on my desk.
Okay, that works outfine for me.
Where's your desk?Doug knowswhere my desk is.
Craig, are yougood with this?
Yeah, that should work outpretty good for me, too.
What the hell?What's happened to us?
I don't know,but suddenly I feel
All sweet and warmand fuzzy.
It seems we're in a universe
Where everything is drawnby disney.
Look, there'sour house.
(laughing)
Look howgaily we run!
Oh, stewie and brian, you'rejust in time for pie.
Peter:Did somebody say "pie"?
(bright orchestralintro plays)
&#9834; it's a wonderful day for pie &#9834;
&#9834; you can ask all the birdsin the sky &#9834;
&#9834; and they'll tell you realsweet with a musical tweet &#9834;
(quagmire's voice):&#9834; it's a wonderful dayfor pie &#9834;
&#9834; for pie &#9834;
&#9834; for pie &#9834;
&#9834; for pie &#9834;
&#9834; for pie! &#9834;
This is wonderful, brian.
Oh, let's live in this universe.
Gosh, it's prettyintoxicating, isn't it?
I want to hear moremusic about pie.
&#9834; it's a wonderful day for pie &#9834;
(cleveland's voice):&#9834; and it smellsa lot better than I &#9834;
(giggles)
&#9834; everyone in the house &#9834;
&#9834; and this adam west mouse &#9834;
&#9834; the bees making honey &#9834;
&#9834; this tom tucker bunny &#9834;
&#9834; we all sing with glee'cause we all agree &#9834;
&#9834; it's a wonderful,wonderful day for pie! &#9834;
(herbert's voice):You want a nice, shiny red appleto put in that pie?
All:No!
Brian, we could spendthe rest of our lives here.
It's perfect.Sounds good to me.
Doesn't seem to be a thingwrong with this place.
Hello, everybody.
All:Jew!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.This is a disney universe.
Oh, but look at how shinymy buttons are here.
Just push the...Yeah, yeah,okay, okay.
I'll push the thing.
(bright melody plays)
Whoa, this is trippy.
I should say so. We're inthe robot chicken universe.
Will you guys move?You're blocking the tv.
Look! Gi joe, transformers,thundercats, he-man!
Yay! Those shows existed!
How's it feel to be on a majornetwork for 30 seconds?
(bleep) you!
Bye.
My god. This placelooks terrible.
Looks like quahogwas vaporized or something.
It says that in this universe,frank sinatra was never born,
And therefore, he was unableto use his influence
To get kennedy elected.
So, nixon wonthe 1960 election
And totally botched thecuban missile crisis,
Causing world war iii.
Wow, so I guess lee harveyoswald never shot kennedy?
No, he shot mayor mccheese.
(shots firing)
(crowd screaming)
That joke'snot in bad taste, right?
Oh, who cares?He's a cheeseburger.
Ew. Where are we?
I don't know. The device can'tmake heads or tails of it.
It's just some sort of weird,low resolution blocky universe.
Lois, where is my supper?
Still in the oven.
Will I have it soon?Quite soon.
Thank you!You're welcome!
Nyah!Nyah!
Nyah!Nyah!
Nyah!Nyah!
Nyah!Nyah!
I'm frightened.Let's go.
Love it.Hate it.
Love it.Hate it.
Uh, brian?Yeah?
This feels weird.
Hit the button.
Oh, god, what is this?
I feel like I'm on acidor something.
According to the multiverseguide, this is a universe
Where everything is depicted
As a washington postpolitical cartoon.
Good lord, I'm naked.
And why am I holdinga dinner platter
That says mccain/ feingold?
(laughing)
That's-that's pretty good.
That's-that's funny.
You don't get it.
No, no, I totally get it.
Oh, god.Let's go, quick.
Here comes an overweight catwith dollar signs for eyes
And a hat that says"social security,"
Pouring a bucket that says"alternative minimum tax"
Over a sad statue of libertyholding a democracy umbrella.
(laughing):Yes!
Oh, that oughtto wake people up.
Shut the (bleep) up.
Oh, my god.Now we're nowhere.
Not quite, brian.
This is a universe,but its only inhabitant
Is one really far away guywho yells compliments.
I like your shirt!
Thank you!
This was nice.
We did it. We're back.
No. This is the universeof misleading portraiture.
Aw.
Oh, wait. It's not so bad.There's the compliment guy.
Hello!
(groans)they got both of us!
We're finished. We'renever going to get home.
We're never going tosee our peter and lois
Or anyone else weknow ever again.
You got your pal stewie.
Great.Aw, you could learnsomething from compliment guy.
And you know,it's not as bad as you think.
I may havefinally figured this out.
I just need to makea few more calculations...
Whoa.
Sorry about that.Bad girl, holly.
No jumpies.
Oh, it's quite all right.
Um, wow.Okay, this is ridiculous.
You go here.You, you naughty little wire,
You're supposed to be over here.
How did you get over there?
Oh, yeah.
Come on, holly,let's go.
This guy's a freak.
And that should do it.
Now, let's go home.
Hey! What the hellare you doing?
I just don't think weshould be too hasty.
I mean, we have aunique opportunity
To study alternateuniverses in depth.
Brian,give me the damn device.
Give it.(groaning)
No, knock it off.Give it.
No, stop it. Stop it.Come on, give it.
No. Come on.Come on.
(clattering, crashing)
What the hell, man?
What the hell?Look what you did!
You better put thatthing on a leash, sir,
Or I'm going tohave to fine you.
Take your stinkin' paws off me,you damn dirty dog.
What the hell were you thinking, Brian?
We're never goingto get home now.
Why the hell would youbreak the damn device?
Look, it was anaccident, all right?
And besides,look at this place.
It's a world run by dogs.
I mean, I kind of wantto explore this universe.
Oh, you like role reversal?
Huh? Okay.
Wait, what are you doing?Oh! Oh! Come on!
Pick up my poop!Pick up my poop!
I'm not pickingup your poop!
Hey, you.Pick up that poop.
You heard him, brian.Pick up my poop.
Go on, pick it up.Do it-- pick up my poop!
I need a plastic bag.
Here's a thin napkin.
Okay, I'm a a new neighbor andyou're my pet human hotchkiss.
Got it?I-I-I don't...
I'm not so crazyabout "hotchkiss" anymore.
What do you mean? Youcame up with hotchkiss.
I know, but...
How about axel or-or-ormaximilian or dex, you know?
It's-it's got to havean "x" in it because...
'cause that meansI have cool parents
Who take me on expensiveski trips on spring break
And I getto drink wine with dinner,
Even thoughI'm only 14, and...
(rings doorbell)
Oh, my god! I know that sound!
That means there's a potentialintruder at the front door
Or one of my pals.Either way, I'm really excited
And ready foranything! Hello?
(chuckles)
Hello, my nameis blake carrington.
Aw.And this ismy human, gabe.
Oh, no. What?
We just moved indown the street
And thought we'd stop inand say hi to our new neighbors.
Well, great to meet you.Come on in. I'm peter.
This is my family.My wife lois.
My son, chris-- chris,stop licking yourself
And come up and say hi!
My daughter meg.
Our puppy stewie.
And this isour human brian.
Nice to meet you.
"say hito human brian, blake,"
Says gabe.Hi.
Mommy, I want to playwith the new human.
Only if it's okaywith blake.
Uh, yeah, sure,it's fine.
Gabe is great with puppies.
I swear to god, I hopethe next universe we go to
Is all koreans.
I know who you are, stewie.
I beg your pardon?
I've perfectedmultiverse travel, as well.
In fact, I've figured out
How to navigatewith absolute precision.
Really?I haven't.
We've been jumping randomlyfrom one universe to the next.
Did you havethe "shuffle" button on?
Oh, my god.There you go.
That's why thatlittle symbol...
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.The twocrossed arrows...
There it is....Is up therein the corner.
There's your problem.Oh, my god. I feel silly.
But I can't doanything about it.
My device hasbeen destroyed.
Well, I've got one of my own.I can use it to send you back.
Hold on, I'll get it.
(doorbell rings)
Oh, my god! Who is it? I got it!
Morning, peter.Hey, joe.
Bonnie and Iare having company tonight,
Wondering if I couldborrow some wet food.
Yeah, sure thing.
That's joe.He's our local human catcher.
So don't misbehave or the humancatcher'll come after you...
Gabe.
My name's not gabe!(growls)
Ow!(screams)
Oh, you're in big trouble,you little crap!
Boy, you shouldn't havedone that, little fella.
You just earned yourselfa trip to the pound!
(muffled screams)
(screams)
Who the helldo you think you are?!
Brian! Brian!
Do something!
Look, I'm sorry about this.
Let me just pay the fineor whatever
And I'll make surethis doesn't happen again.
You can pickhim up tomorrow.
Oh. Okay.
Just bring a trash bag.
(wheels squeaking)
What did he mean by that?
Any human that bitesa dog gets euthanized.
You know that.No, he doesn't!
He's from another universe wheredogs are subservient to humans.
Oh, you mean likethat time we...Yeah.
When we bounced aroundbetween univ...Yeah.
And you couldn't figure outhow to...Yes!
Oh, they're goingto kill him!
We got to get himout of there!
It's a tough world here.
You hear about it every nighton the dog news.
Coming up, that bush in the parkis my bush!
My bush!
Look, there he is!
Oh, thank god. I'm saved.
Come on,let's get out of here.
All right, the two of you,stand over there
And I'll send you backwhere you belong.
Gosh, brian,I sure hope this next leap...
Will be the leap home.
Human brian:Wait!
Take me with you.
What do you mean? You can'tcome back to our universe.
Come on, a placewhere humans are in charge?
I can't pass that up.
Dog joe:Hey!
Get away from there!
(grunting)
Well, this looks like home.
Is there any waywe can be sure?
Hmm.
Mom, have you seenmy trapper keeper?
(farting)
(laughing)
Both:Yeah, we're home!
(laughing)
Well, now, what do we doabout this guy?
We got two briansin our universe now.
Don't worry, I don'tplan to stay in quahog.
I'm gonna go out into the world
And seewhat I can make of myself.
I can be somebody here.
And it should be easyfor you, because...
I mean-- what luck--you're white.
You have no ideahow big that is here.
Good-bye, stewie.Good-bye, brian.
Maybe our pathswill cross again someday.
Ah, look at him go.
Free in a worldof his own kind,
Where he can finally reachthe full potential--
Oh, my god!He got hit by a car! </div>\t'
