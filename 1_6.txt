How's the garage sale going,Quagmire?
Pretty good. Just clearing some ofmy stuff out of the basement.
It's amazing what you find when youclean your basement.
Peter, you almost done down there?
(LAUGHS) Look what I found!
That's wonderful, Peter.Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna do some sky-writing.
# WITCH'S THEME FROM WIZARD OF OZ #
(EVIL LAUGHTER)
Hey, look at all these videosMr Quagmire is selling.
Wow. The Best Of The World's WildestPolice Chases!
And it even has the onewith The Flintstones.
(SIRENS AND HORNS BLASTING)
VOICEOVER: Amazingly, thisdrunk-driver turns left intooncoming traffic.
He narrowly misses hitting apedestrian
who jumps out of the wayjust in time.
Now the driver can add attemptedbattery to the charges.
The driver turns right into theparking lot of a drive-in movietheatre.
At this point, the dinosaur in theback seat
pokes his head up through the roof
and the driver places two smallchildren on top of it.
Now he's not only endangering hisown life, but their lives as well.
The driver totals the carand makes a run for it.
But the pursuing officers areprepared.
Running from the cops?Yabba-dabba-don't!
Hey, Quagmire, I think I might wantto buy this ham radio off you.
That'll be $50.50 bucks?
All right, fine, I'll buy it.
Man, this is a bigger rip-off thanShrinky Dinks.
They've already been shrunk.Happy birthmas.
(WHINING AND STATIC)
Peter, you've been fiddling withthat ham radio for seven weeks.
Take a shower. I can barely get anyreception on this stupid thing.
So far the only station that comes inis some British guys reading news
from places I'm not sure exist.
RADIO BROADCASTER: Today,in Kuzikistan,
a peaceful demonstration turned tobloodshed
as members of the Turzili tribeflooded Kenpao Square
in remembrance of the thirdanniversary
of the Holmsburg Massacre.
But finally, some good news out ofneighbouring Kanduzi
as locals there have reached anuneasy alliance
with the bordering Trolika BubsieWubsie Dal.
And now with sports,here's Framptal Tromwibbler.
From the world of sport,the Contein Spinky Whompers
flumped the Floing BoingWelfenclumpers
70-fluff to 40-flabe.
At the tone, the timewill be 26 railroad.
(TONE)I'm not sure about any of that.
You know, Dad, I saw that movieWhite Noise
and they said you can use emptyradio static to talk to dead people.
You idiot! Ghosts don't exist.
Wait a second, they might.
(STATIC)
Hello, ghosts.Come in, ghosts.
MAN: Hello.Hello? Who's this?
This is Ronald Reagan.Ronald Reagan?
The guy that used to bang that 70-lbswitch?
Ronald Reagan, former president ofthe United States.
Oh, my God!
Hey, Quagmire, guess who I'm talkingto right now.
Yep.
Brian, will you takeme down to Baby Gap?
I want to dress like a small douche.
No, maybe tomorrow or Tuesday.But you said you'd do it today.
I'm kinda tired. Oh, for God's sake.Cancel my Tuesday appointments.
Sure thing, Stewie. You want me tomove it to another day?
No, no. Just cancel it.OK, will do.
Who the hell was that? Hm?There was another Stewie rightthere.
Oh, yeah. Well, I've beenso damn busy lately
my schedule has been so packed,
I felt like I needed some kind of anerrand boy
to do all my nitpickypain-in-the-arse stuff
so I cloned myself. You...you clonedyourself?!
What are you, deaf?So he's an exact copy of you?
Well, not exact. I have to remainsuperior
so I bred out some of theintelligence.
Made him sort of a simpleton,you know?
I call him Bitch Stewie.
Would you like to meet him?
Would you like to meet Bitch Stewie?
Uh, yeah, I guess.Bitch Stewie!
Come here and meet my friend, Brian.
Hey there, Stewie. Oh, what's that,you got a friend?
Oh, I'm always happy to meet one ofyour friends!
Dear God... How do you do?Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bitch Stewie.He's got quite a grip.
Bitch Stewie, why are there nomidget accountants?
Because they always come up short.
(LAUGHS LOUDLY) Oh, another goodone, Stewie!
I don't know where you come up withthem. Isn't he wonderful?
And all I have to feed himis a crude peanut paste.
Watch this.
(MOANS HAPPILY)
It's not much, but it's healthierthan what people ate in the '50s.
Steak and donut sandwich, please.
You want cigarettes on thatsandwich? Do I look like a Mary?
Yes, I want cigarettes!
OK, next up on the stage, let's havea big karaoke welcome for Peter andRon.
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) OK, this isone of our favourites,
hope it's one of yours.
# ELTON JOHN &amp; KIKI DEE -Don't Go Breaking My Heart #
# Don't go breaking my heart
# I couldn't even if I tried(FEEDBACK WHINES LOUDLY)
# Oh, honey, if I get restless
# Baby, you're not that kind(FEEDBACK CONTINUES)
# Don't go breaking my heart
# You'll take the weight off of me(FEEDBACK CONTINUES)
# Oh, honey,when I knock on your door
# I give you my key... #(FEEDBACK CONTINUES)
Oh, sorry. Didn't realise somebodywas in here - What the hell?
Oh, hello, Brian. Oh, there's yourfriend, Brian.
Hey, Brian! I sure did enjoy talkingto you the other day.
I'm just making sure Stewie is niceand clean
for his trip to the playground thisafternoon.
We had a little bit of a problemearlier
because Bitch Stewie was stooling inthe tub, wasn't he?
I did some poos, I did some poos.I didn't mean to.
But we rectified that now andeverything's fine.
This is really weird.
It's one thing to have him help youout with a busy schedule,
it's another thing to let him washyour back. He does more than that.
Bitch Stewie, giveme a bubble beard.
Look at me, I'm George Bernard Shaw.
(LAUGHS) That's awful funny, Stewie!
I don't know who George Bernard Shawis,
but you look like an old Stewie,Stewie.
Enjoy your weird bath.
I told him I did the poos, eventhough you did the poos, Stewie.
Did I do good, Stewie. That was verycorrect of you, Bitch Stewie.
You're a good helper.
And what a lot of people don't knowis that I was Jane Wyman's first.
You might say I broke her'Jane Wyman.'
(ALL LAUGH)
Reagan is a delight!He sure is.
And you know what else?The ghost of Reagan
is gonna be the new fourth guy in ourgroup.
I'm all for that! What other storiesyou got, Reagan?
Well, I remember the time I invitedEd Sullivan to the White House.
He sounded a little something likethis -
"Hey, Ron. Tonight we've got areally big show."
Ah, Reagan does impressions!
That's right. And you know who elsedoes impressions? Rich Little.
In fact, you ought to go see hisshow at the Mohegan Sun Casino
next Saturday at 3:00pm and 5:00pm.
Wait a second...Yeah, no (BLEEP)
What? Peter, that's not RonaldReagan, that's Rich Little!
You're Rich Little! He must be onhis own ham radio.
AS JOHNNY CARSON: Uh, well, youknow, Ed, the kids say you gotta goviral
to promote yourself these days.So this is not Reagan?
No, it's Rich Little!He's an impressionist.
He's been screwing with your head!This thing is worthless.
Like my Palestinian alarm clock.
Allahu Akbar!
Hey, Peter, what's up?Hey, Quagmire.
Listen, I'm here to get my money backfor that ham radio.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there,partner. All sales are final.
But you were Agamemnon with meduring the sale.
What? I just saw that wordsomewhere, I wanted to use it.
Peter, why don't you just go homebefore you get hurt?
I'm clearly not the only one who wasdissatisfied with his purchase.
Whoever bought that baby from youobviously didn't want it.
A baby? I didn't sell a baby.
Look, there's a note.
"Glenn, this is your child.Next time wear a condom, jerk."
Oh, my God!Now hang on, Quagmire.
There's no guarantee it's your baby.
Giggety?Oh, I say that...
Well, the DNA test results are back.
This little girl is definitely yourbaby, Quagmire.
What am I supposed to do?I don't want a baby!
Look, somebody's gotta take this kidoff my hands. I can't be a father!
Glenn, you don't have a choice.This baby is your responsibility.
Now, I brought you a basket ofthings to get you started.
There's baby clothes, some toysand some books.
Now, if you have any questions,we're right across the street.
Hey. What's going on?
Not really sure what I'm supposed todo with you.
There's some frozen steaks in thefreezer.
Bathroom's down the hallto the right.
Uh, if you ever come home andthere's a tie on the door
it means I'm froggin' someone sogive me at least a...couple ofhours.
You smoke?
Stewie, what are you doing here?
I thought you were going to BobbyStalling's birthday party. I hatethat kid.
And I hate children's birthdayparties. I sent Bitch Stewie in myplace.
(CHILDREN LAUGHING) What a greatlittle party, Janet.
You know, I've never seen Stewiecome out of his shell so much.
Oh, no! It's not on his tail,it's on his face! I've ruined it.
Oh, no! That's OK, though. Somebodyelse will come along and get itright.
Thanks for coming to my birthdayparty, Stewie.
I wouldn't have missed it foranything. I've never been to a partybefore!
Want to watch me blow out thecandles?
I'd love to see that!And, gosh, Bobby,
I'd love to play with some of yourbirthday toys
but only after you've played withthem and you say it's OK.
You know, Stewie, I gotta say thatclone of yours has come in prettyhandy.
I uh, don't suppose you'd considermaking one of those for me, wouldyou?
(LAUGHS) Maybe. What would you bewilling to do for me?
What do you want?
Take your index fingerand your thumb
and lightly gripthe base of your tail.
What? Lightly grip the base of yourtail
with your index fingerand your thumb
and then slide your fingers up thelength of your tail to the tip.
Why? Because that's whatI asked you to do.
That's kinda weird. Is this some kindof sexual thing?
Nobody said anything about sexual.There's nothing sexual about it.
I'm just asking you to perform asimple task.
Take your index fingerand your thumb
and lightly grip the base of yourtail
and run your fingers along thelength of your tail.
You mean stroke it?Nobody used that word.
It is not a stroking motion. This isa completely non-sexual thing
I am asking you to do in acompletely non-sexual way.
Squeeze the base of the tail lightlywith your thumb and index finger
and then, while continuing tosqueeze,
run them up the length of your tailto the tip,
and I'll make you a clone.
I only have to do it once?I'll tell you when to stop.
(LAUGHS) I don't know why you'restopping! Nobody told you to stop.
Give me a little smile.
Your lips look a little dry.Why don't you wet them a little bit?
(LAUGHS) My God! You're SO weird!
All right, I'll make you a clone,buddy.
Aw, she's a beautiful little girl,Glenn.
Have you given her a name yet?Yeah, I named her Anna Lee
but I'm probably just gonna call herAnnal for short. That's funny. Thankyou.
Anyway, thanks for all the babystuff. What's that big tarp overthere?
That was Chris's blankiefrom when he was a baby.
He was a big kid. Almost split Louisin half coming out of her.
It's true. I never mention thisbecause I don't want him to feel bad
but after he was born, they had torearrange most of my organs.
Oh, yeah. He dragged half of Louisright out with him.
The doctors said I'll be lucky if Ilive past 50,
but Chris is healthy and I thank Godfor that.
Oh, there you are, Brian. Are youready to meet your clone?
Am I ever. I've got a to-do listthree pages long for him.
OK, I want to qualify this byreminding you
that, as with my clone, theintelligence level is reduced a bit.
That's good. We don't want himthinking too much.
I might have dialled yours back alittle more than I ought to have.What do you mean?
Brian, meet Bitch Brian.Hi, Brian.
You've got some stuff you want me todo for you?
Oh, my God! Yeah, that's kind of whatI said, too.
You know, I'll be honest with you,Brian, here's what happened.
I didn't really want to do the work,so Bitch Stewie sort of did it.
Hey, Stewie! How did the clone turnout?
Brian, I can't go to the bathroom bymyself.
Will you please help me?But I'm good at other stuff!
(DOORBELL)
Hello, Candy.Hi, Glenn.
Come on in.
(JAZZ MUSIC)
So, how long you beenin beauty school?
Two months.Well, tonight we're doing facials.
(BABY CRYING)
Oh, God. Hang on a second.
OK, OK, stop.Just stop crying.
Stop crying, Anna Lee. Oh, nowonder. You dropped your pacifier.
(VIBRATES)
You have a baby?Yeah, it's a long story.
Damn kid's kept me up each night fortwo weeks.
Now, where were we?Giggety, giggety!
(SNORING)
Glenn, you fell asleep,so I took off.
It's probably for the best.I've never had sex before
and I probably wouldn't have beenmuch good at it.
(YELLS)(BABY CRIES)
That's it. That kid is outta here!
Hey, there's another note.
"Glenn, this is your child.Next time wear a condom, jerk - "
Oh, that's the note from earlier.
I need a file cabinet.
So, it's just not working out mebeing a father
and that's why I'm wondering if youand Louis
would be willing to adopt the baby.Uh...oh, boy, Quagmire.
I don't know if we can do that. Wecan barely take care of the two wehave.
Now this is just a suggestion,just throwing it out there,
have you considered abortion? Peter,I think it's too late for that.
Don't let the press put the scareinto you.
Wade v. Boggs has not beenoverturned.
Yeah, but you can't really abort alive baby.
Oh, boy, they have got you!
Glenn, Glen...(WHISPERING) Give her back to God.
I'm gonna go ahead and move theconversation forward.
Is there any way you guys can takeAnna Lee?
No, Quagmire. We got enough kids ofour own. Plus old Brian over there.
Right, Buddy. I sharpened a pencil inmy bum and now I need a band-aid.
You're doing the right thing,Quagmire.
All right, Quagmire, just so you'reclear on the law,
once you give this child up to theadoption agency
you can no longer abort it.
Hello, sir. Do you wish to put thischild up for adoption?
Yeah, it's not working out.I need to get her out of my hair.
We can help you there.Is it a boy or a girl?
It's a girl. Her name's Anna Lee.
Oh, beautiful name.Let me take her from you.
Well, go on, Quagmire.Give her the baby.
I...I will.
I just...
Oh. Here.
She uh...she'll go to a good home,right?
Oh, yes. She'll be somewhere safe,right?
Like, you're not gonna put her withSand People, right?
You mean like from Star Wars?(LAUGHS) No, no. No, no, no.
Brian, I didn't know if you wanted aGod's Eye, but I made you one.
Uh...OK. Thank you.
Did you wash my car like I asked?No, but I hit with a rock.
OK, thanks. Brian, I think my jaw isfalling off.
Oh! Oh! Stewie, what is happening tothis thing?
Oh, yeah. Turns out the clonesaren't too stable, Brian.
I've been having some trouble withmine, too.
Hey, Stewie, everything sounds likerushing water.
And I can't stand up so very good.
Yeah, I figure they've got less thana minute before they dissolvecompletely.
Hey, Brian. Knock, knock...Who's there?
(BREAKS WIND)(LAUGHS)
Well, I hope that doesn't happento me.
He took my dry cleaning and I haveno idea what he did with the ticket.
Yeah, this was nota fruitful endeavour.
I'm not proud of this,but I need to lick that up.
(LOUD MUSIC AND MEN CHEERING)
This will be great, Quagmire. A nudiebar is the perfect way
to celebrate your first night withouta baby.
Peter, this is great.I feel like myself again.
I tell you, my life was so dominatedby that baby, I'm glad she's gone.
You know, sometimes you just gottamake a decision and go with it.
Like when I decided to try thatradical penis enlargement.
Peter, I don't think - Brian, yourobjections are duly noted. Hit thegas!
(TYRES SCREECH)
You know that would never work againin a million years.
Don't need it to, Brian.
(LAUGHS) That stripperhas a rash on her ass
just like Anna Lee used to get.
Uh, yeah. And that other stripper'ssitting on that guy's lap
just like Anna Lee used to do.
I guess. And that stripper only hasone tooth, just like Anna Lee.
Quagmire, you feeling OK?
I don't know. I think I might havemade a terrible mistake.
I abandoned my daughter.
Why did I give awaymy only daughter?
(SOBBING)
Oh, God!
(SOBBING CONTINUES)
He'll be fine. We shouldn't let thisruin our night.
Let's just enjoy the strippers.I guess.
I just hate the way that one gets sointo her work.
You boys have been very naughty.
I'm gonna have to assign you extrahomework.
Darn it, fractions are so hard.What'd you get for number four?
She said don't share answers!
All right, here it is. 625 Maple.
That's the familythat adopted Anna Lee.
Hey, wait. Wait, guys.
Well, it's just meand my old nemesis.
First step. (LAUGHS) Hey, Joe, whatyou doing? You out for a walk (?)
I hate this block.
(GASPS) There she is.There's Anna Lee!
Hang on, Anna Lee. I'm coming!
(GASPS) It's them!
Look at her.She looks so happy.
Almost like she belongs there.
They look like a real family.
I can't take her away from this.
(YELLING) What's happening?
He's not gonna go through with it.
It's a nice family and the kid willbe better off here.
Oh, that's sweet! What's the insideof the house look like?
Colonial. Furniture's pretty good.Possibly imported area rug.
Oh, that's nice! A bit pricey, butfor the money you're spending
you know, it's not a bad way to go.
Yeah, for the money!Ready to go, Quagmire?
Yeah. You know, I gotta tell you,I think you did a good thing.
I guess I just realisedit's not about me.
This family is what's bestfor Anna Lee.
This is her home now.I gotta let her go.
I'm proud of you, Quagmire.Thanks, man.
Hey, who knows? Maybe I'll bump intoher in 18 years.
What?! Did you really think I wasgonna change that much?
Goodnight, everybody!
