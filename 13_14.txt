&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Say, you fellas knowif Jerome serves dessert here?
I got a real hankeringfor pudding.
That's so weird.
I was just thinking aboutpudding on the way over here.
Okay, well,you two are clearly in love,
but I could also gofor some pudding.
Why we all got puddingon the brain?
It's got to bethat new billboard
advertising puddingon the highway.
We all drove past iton the way here.
Huh.Well, that's no surprise.
Everyone in my housecan get very excited
by a good ad campaign.
(tires screeching)
Lois! Lois, it's back!
I heard, Peter!I heard!
Kids, kids, it's happening!
Get your coats!This is what we practiced for!
(barking, cheering)
I love you, Dad!
I love you, too, sweetheart!
None of the past matters!
Oh, yeah, I seenthat pudding billboard.
It's that one that says"CBS Outdoor Advertising" on it.
Yeah, but right above that is,like, a big guy eating pudding.
I don't remember none of that.
I just remember"CBS Outdoor Advertising"
on the bottom and three pigeonssitting on top.
You're bad at lookingat billboards.
Hey, we should gocheck it out right now.
Ordinarily I'd say no, butthat adult kickball league
is coming in for drinks,so let's get out of here.
Guys, check it out.
I've got flip-up shadeson my flip-up shades.
Dude, you are the worst.
Hey, we're all the worst.
That's realpudding in there.
What? No, it isn't.
They wouldn't put real puddingon a billboard, Peter.
Do you have any idea howcrippled you sound right now?
Peter, it's not real pudding.
God, sometimes I just wantto shake some sense into you.
Big talk for a guywho looks like a dad
at a Dave Matthews'concert.
Everybody hates howyou dress, right, Joe?
Sorry, I stay outof fashion debates.
I've been burnedone too many times.
Hey, guys,notice anything different?
Yeah, Minetti's gota hot new look.
The whole thing,it just works.
(growling):Minetti.
Look, there's only oneway to settle this.
I am climbing that billboardto prove it's real pudding.
Moisturizer?
Sure.Okay.
We getting oninto the chappy season.
Peter, be carefulup there!
Is this beingcareful enough, Joe?
Okay. All right.
(screams)
Peter, are you okay?!
All right, there's no pudding,but there is a kid up here.
QUAGMIRE:Don't hold him like that.
Oh, my God!
Peter, that's the lostNicholson kid!
He's been missing for a week!
Oh, yeah.
They arrested acustodian 'cause of you.
Peter, stay put.I'll call this in,
and we'll get a crewout here to help you both down.
(sighs) All right,but can you hurry it up?
I got band practice later.
(salsa music playing)
PETER:I love playing the maracas.
They're so fun.
I wonder what's in them.
Sand or rice probably.
Maybe it's little shells.
Oh, no, what if it's bones?
No, no, bones are too big.
But baby bones aren't.
No, no, no, nobody would killa bunch of babies for maracas.
How would you killall those babies anyway?
I'd probably put them in a tub.
You could kill, like,eight at a time that way.
Plus, it softens them up,
so you can getthe bones right out.
Joe just had a baby.
And I got a baby at home.
I got a tub.
Peter, you seem off today.
Are you thinkingabout killing infants again?
No.
Now you got to kill them, too.
Mikey, you're safe!
Thank you so muchfor finding my boy.
Thank you forfinding her boy.
I'm the stepfather.
Peter Griffin,in recognition of your heroism
in helping to rescuelittle Mikey Nicholson,
I'd like to present youwith this key to the city.
Now, don't forget to waterthe plants every other day
and change the cat's litter.
I'll see you in two weeks.
No parties.
Thank you, Mayor West.
You know, some of youout there are calling me a hero.
Others are calling me a hoagie.
Those of you from Connecticutare calling me a grinder.
I guess whatI'm trying to say is
I'm not just pieces of meatbetween pieces of bread.
I am a manwho unintentionally saves kids.
Wow.
20 years on the force,
and no one's ever clappedfor me.
Except for that onesarcastic gay guy.
Great observation.
I know you mean the oppositeof what you're saying.
Fact is, when I saved that boy,I wasn't thinking.
I don't think. I just do.
I wanted to see if a billboardhad real pudding in it,
so I climbed up thereand came out a hero.
It's just like Gandhialways said,
eat as much as you wantand do whatever,
and don't be afraidto hit each other.
Way to go, Dad.
Peter, that thing yousaid about not thinking
and just doing stuff,did you mean that?
Sure I did, Joe.
I never stop to think.
That's why I've had ringworm11 times.
I will roll in anything.
You know what, you're right.
And it's time I dothe same thing.
Hey, Chief. It's Swanson.
I quit.
Joe Swanson.
I don't knowif Ray Swanson's quitting.
You'd have to ask him.
Okay, you just called meRay again.
I just want to confirm thatyou understand that this is Joe.
No, not "see you tomorrow."
Joe, what are you doing?You can't quit your job.
Well, that'sthe other thing, Bonnie.
You and I are done, too.
What?!
I'm leaving you.
(whoops) New Joe!
Wow. I can't remember thelast time Joe shot his gun.
I know. That bullet'sbeen rolling around
in his junk drawer for years.
Hey, Ma, guess where I am?
Yeah, can you hear it?
Flying through the air.
I don't know what he shot at.
I guess I'll just haveto find out when I land.
(chuckles)No, don't put Terry on.
You-you can just tell him.
H-Hey. Hi, Terry.
Oh, God.
What?"What?"
You know what.
I think it looks good.
You are, you are justtrying anything, aren't you?
Just searching foran identity, man.
And you think thisis gonna be it, huh?
Oh, God, whatever.
Peter, I'm worriedabout Joe.
You know, not onlydid he quit his job,
he's moved out and gottenhis own apartment.
Oh, I feel terrible forBonnie and the kids.
Ah, they'll be fine.They'll bounce back.
Just like Humpty Dumpty didafter his fall.
My God, it's a miracle!
You were able to put meback together again.
Yeah, it was actuallya pretty simple procedure.
Maybe next time go straightto a medical professional
and skip the horsesand illiterate servants.
Well, that is the last timeI drink and masturbate
on top of a high wall.
Wait, wait, Quagmire, hold up.
I got a great knock.
(knocking "Shave and a Haircut")
(giggles)Oh, I got to remember that.
Oh, hey, guys.How's it going?
(gently):Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
You okay?
Everything okay?
I'm talking like thisbecause I'm being very careful
not to upset you,and for some reason
this is the voice people useto do that.
I'm great.Come on in.
Check out the new pad.
Whoa!
You got an air hockey table?
Yep. Wanted it, got it.
That's the new Joe.
And check this out.
It's the gunthat no-leg sprinter used
to kill his girlfriend.
Oh, my God!
Eh, anyone who's kind of fastgets a free pass from me.
What kind of personwould want to buy that?
I'll tell you who.
The kind of guywho's always got
butterscotch candiesfor his friends.
Okay, now that's pretty cool.
I got to be honest,Joe, we came over here
because we wereworried about you,
but these candies tellme you're doing great.
I've never been better.
I was living my life all wrong.
But not anymore.
No more thinking, just living.
Well, it seems like you madethe right choice, Joe.
I mean, I ain't seenanyone this happy
since the inventionof the penny-farthing bicycle.
Eureka! Watch it go.
Higher than you,faster than you,
better than you.
Everyone just stop inventingstuff now,
'cause no onewill ever top this.
(laughter)Oh, no!
Keep rakes away.
I expressly said no rakesallowed on the street
when I am riding myfuturistic machine.
(groans)
Children, this is progress!
How can you turn a blind eyeto progress?!
(groaning)
I expressly said no rakes.
'Sup, ladies?
Oh, we're not ladies, you.
Hey, what's withthe suitcase?
I got a surprise.
What would you guys thinkof a road trip?
Yeah!All right, I'm in!
Awesome, road trip!
I love being super pumpedfor 15 minutes
and then bored out of my mindfor eight hours.
Where we going?
Well, I was thinkingNiagara Falls.
Niagara Falls?
Ain't that just for lovers?
Nah, it's for everybody.
It's great to just stand there
and let Mother Nature spray itall over your face.
Donna's big fat aunt is in town,so I can definitely go.
Man, I am fillingthese Gatorade bottles
as fast as I'm drinking them.
Ah, sweet! Cows!
Let's tip them over.
What? You wantto tip over some cows?
Hell yeah!
This is gonnabe so boss.
I can't wait.
This is the hardest thingI've ever done in my life.
All right, cow.
This is what you getfor standing.
That...
was awesome.
PETER:I want to kiss that cow,
but I don't want itto be my idea.
Hey, Peter, you shouldkiss that cow.
All right, Peter,that was fortuitous.
But play it cool.
Oh, Cleveland, I couldn't.
Okay. Quagmire,you should kiss that cow.
Sure, why not?
(screams)
JOE:Okay, they're sleeping.
We're gonna have to partyin the bathroom.
Be careful aroundthe really fat one.
He's kind of like my boss.
QUAGMIRE:What? Who-who's there?
Joe, what the hellare you doing?
I went toa high school kegger party.
Made a few new friends.
This is Chrysalis,Ichabod and Cancer.
Oh, I seethree young men
who could use thetickle monster.
Uh, that's a bad read, Pete.
Joe, it's 3:00in the morning.
We're trying toget some sleep.
You guys are lame.
We're gonna go smokesomething called "croak."
God, what the hellhas gotten into Joe?
I don't know, Quagmire.
Maybe you couldask the tickle monster!
(laughing)Stop it!Here he comes!
No! Get away!He's gonna get ya!
Look out!
Great, now I'm fully up.
Here we are, guys,Niagara Falls.
We showed them.
We showed them all!
Showed who? What thehell's he talking about?
I don't know.
I stopped listening to himback at the drive-thru
when he leaned out the windowand ordered a "fur burger."
That's not funny;that's just nasty.
Plus, there's people waitingbehind you!
Wow. You know, whenyou see it up close,
it really isincredible.
Yeah. Holy crap,it's beautiful.
In the future, I believethere will be water wars.
You know, Lois always dreamedabout coming here,
and now I know why.
She was evensaving money for it.
You made it, Lois.
You made it.
Didn't I tell you guys?
It's the most magnificent placein the world.
And the greatest placeto end it all.
Good-bye, fellas.
Oh, my God, Joe killed himself!
It's so weirdthat he argued
over the priceof breakfast this morning.
(sobs)It makes no sense!
JOE:Damn it!
Joe?
(gasps)Joe, you're alive!
Are you hurt?
I'm not sure.
Well, hang in there, Joe,we'll get some help.
No! Just let me die!
Oh, no, can't do that, Joe.
We're friends.
We look out for each other.
I mean, you supported methat day
I accidentally woreLois's jeans.
Peter, you knowyou're wearing...
I know. I thinkthere was a mix-up.
Oh, thank you, Jazzercize.
(truck beeping)
Don't worry, Joe.They're coming for you.
MAN:Yay! My backpack!
Hang in there, Joe.
After they get that lady's hat,you're next.
WOMAN:Thank you.
It's windy up here.
(truck beeping)
Joe, what the hellis wrong with you?
Why would you tryto kill yourself?
Why do you think? I'm worthless.
But y-you've been so happythese last few days.
I've been manic.
Do you think Andy Dickis happy?
I couldn't imagine, no.
Look, when I saw Peterbecome a hero,
I guess it reminded meof all the things I can't do.
I'm a cop who can't save anyone.
I'm a husbandin a legless marriage.
My whole life is a joke.
But somehow, as soonas I decided to kill myself,
I actually felt free.
Almost giddy.
I can finally kissthis worthless life good-bye.
Let me getthis straight.
The whole point of bringingus to Niagara Falls
was just tokill yourself?
I'm sorry I trickedyou guys into coming.
I just wanted to spendmy last week with my best pals.
Well, not for nothing, butyou could've taken us all
to Disney World and shotyourself in the room.
Come on, Joe, there's plentyof reasons to live.
Like, like, you're handsome.
You have a handsome face.
Well, he's gota good chin.
I don't knowabout handsome.
Yeah, he's not handsome,but I will say this,
he keeps a good lawn.
Yeah, some might say the secondbest lawn in the neighborhood.
Hey, wait, where's Joe?
Joe, wait!
(truck beeping)
I stink at this.
Anywhere is fine.
Guys, this isunnecessary.
Give me my chair back.
No, we can't trust younot to kill yourself.
Yeah, then you'd bethe tenth friend
who's killed himselfin front of me.
Is that true?
One, two, three,four, five,
six, seven...
those two girls and...
Yeah, yeah, ten.
Look, you guys,what we really need to do
is bring him back to Quahogwhere we can get him some help.
That's a good idea.
We should just go home.
Yeah, I guessyou're right.
It's too bad we alreadybought those tickets
for the WhirlpoolAero Car.
That's $16we're not getting back.
Yeah, what a waste of money.
It is only a ten-minuteride, you know.
Okay, we'll dothe Whirlpool Aero Car,
and then take Joeback to Quahog.
What aboutthe White Water Walk?
Okay, okay, Whirlpool Aero Car,
then White Water Walk,then we bring Joe back.
Well, you can't doNiagara Falls
without riding theMaid of the Mist.
Yeah, let's do everything.Great!
And, guys, remember,the pool towels go home with us.
They got no wayof accounting for those.
Well, this has just beenone heck of a fun day.
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
seeing the natural beautyof this place
is actually making mefeel much better.
Hey, you mind opening that door?
Get a little breeze in here?
Sure.
Peter, no!
I don't regret it.The breeze is nice.
(screaming)
Oh, crap, I'm losing my grip!
You buy your jeansat Wal-Mart?
No, somebody who lost theirsat the church did.
You wearlost-and-found jeans?
I waited the mandatory week.
Hang on, guys!
(screaming)
Don't worry, I'm coming!
What's that thing he's on?
It's a chair with wheels!
He's an absolute dream.
Guys, keep swallowing water.
We'll drink our wayout of this.
Guys, grab on to my legs!
(grunting)
Got it!
Ew. You know, this is actuallythe first time
I've ever touched Joe.
Don't worry, I gotcha.
Oh, thank God, Joe.
I thought I was dead!
I even picturedmy own funeral.
&#9834; Grandma got run overby a reindeer &#9834;
&#9834; Walking home from our houseChristmas Eve... &#9834;
I don't know, Chris.
I don't know whyhe wanted this,
but we're honoringyour father's wishes.
Ah, I'm gonna miss my daddy!
(crowd cheering)
Joe, that was amazing.
You saved us.
Oh, yeah, I guess I did.
You know, I spent the whole timetrying to kill myself,
but it took seeingyou guys almost die
to realize that lifereally is worth living.
See, Joe, you'rea hero, too.
And we wouldn't trade youfor any friend in the world.
Thanks, Peter.
I'm lucky to have you guysin my life.
&#9834; We're four friends &#9834;
&#9834; Having an adventure &#9834;
&#9834; Four friends... &#9834;Whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's that song?Nothing.
I made it up.
Well, stop it.It's terrible.
I don't think so.It's catchy.
&#9834; We're four friends &#9834;
&#9834; Having an adventure &#9834;
ALL:&#9834; Four friends &#9834;
&#9834; Having an adventure &#9834;
&#9834; Four friends &#9834;
Ah, what the hell.&#9834; Having an adventure &#9834;
&#9834; Four friends &#9834;
&#9834; Having an adventure &#9834;
&#9834; At Niagara Falls. &#9834;
(chattering happily)
Wow, that was awesome.
Yeah, definitely.
All right, okay,don't anyone sing anything else
until we get home.We got to record this.
Yeah, that'll be great.
&#9834; I'm a Barbie girlin a Barbie world &#9834;
&#9834; Come on, Barbie,let's go party! &#9834;
Peter, damn it, no!
Wait, wait, we got to rememberthe other one.
What was it, Joe?
(sighs) It's gone.
Well, that was kind of a weirdtrip, but I'm glad we went.
Yeah, I loveNiagara Falls.
I was the only black manever to go there.
The tourists weretaking pictures of me.
One of them thoughtI was a bear.
Hey, guys.
Wow, Joe, you got your job back?
Sure did.
How'd you pull that off?
Ah, they always need more cops.
Turns out, not many people
want to probably get shotfor $24,000 a year.
And what about Bonnie?
How you getting her back?
Well, I got a plan for that.
I hired some guysto come to the house
on Tuesday and assault her,and I'll come in and save her,
and she'll be so grateful,she'll have to take me back.
Joe, today's Tuesday.Well, poop. </div>\t'
