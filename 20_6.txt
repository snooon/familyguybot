&#9834; It seems today
that all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in movies
and sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are those
good old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a man
who positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
"Happy Birthday, Dog"?
Sorry, I spaced on your name
at the party store.

Have a good one, Brent.
(doorbell rings)
Thanks for having us, Peter.
I don't recall
inviting Kevin, but sure.
BRIAN:
His name you remember!
I think it's ridiculous
to have a party for a dog.
Why spend money on something
he can't even comprehend?
(growling)
This ball is nuts.
Hey, happy birthday, Brian!
Bonnie and I got you
a big stick.
Wow, thank you!
I'm gonna take it
into the kitchen
and I don't foresee having
any issues with that.

(grunts)
(grunts)
(grunting)
Okay, I can make this work.
Think, Brent, think.
Uh, Joe,
isn't that the same stick
we gave you for your wedding?
You told me it was a magic wand.
I pointed it at a bus,
the bus crashed,
that's all I'm saying.
Happy Birthday, Brian.
I got you a card.
On the front it says, "Too much
sex ruins your eyesight"
and on the inside it says,
"Happy Birthday,"
but all blurry--
Oh! I gave it away!
It also says,
"Love, Aunt Judy and Uncle Bob."
A joke that good doesn't
celebrate just one birthday.
Well, fellas, I'm off.
Old Joe's got
a big stakeout this week,
so I'm gonna practice
by watching the party
from across the street.
(door closes)
(grunts)
"Those who doubt the wand's
power suffer the wand's wrath."
Leviticus 26:12.
(indistinct chatter)
Was anybody gonna wake me up
for the party?
It's 6:30.
I went down at noon.
Now I'm gonna be up all night,
watching bad reality TV.
ANNOUNCER: We now return to
Uber Driver: Ninja Warrior.
(cheering)
(chime sounds)
ANNOUNCER: First, he's gotta
swing on the gold chains
across the cologne bath without
dropping his e-cigarette.
(cheering)
Next, he's gotta pick up
a ride share customer.
- (revving)
- (tires squealing)
Now he's gonna be late, but
he's going to make it seem like
the passenger's fault
and not his.
Where the hell have you been?
I been here, man.
Maybe you press wrong button.
I don't know.
Now don't talk to me. I'm on
four different phone calls.
Hi, everyone, Peter Griffin.
Welcome to the roast portion
of the evening.
Ladies and gentleman:
my son, Chris.
Born on the highway,
because that is where
most accidents happen.
LOIS: Peter!
But we're here to talk about
Brian getting
another year older.
You know, I hear he can't even
bury a bone these days
without Viagra.
Ha, all right,
all right, I can take it.
And they say you can't teach
an old dog new tricks,
but I heard Brian just learned
how to roll over and beg...
for an erection.
(chuckling) Okay.
That's sort of
just another jab
at my penis, but sure.
On the positive side,
Brian's latest book
was a real page-turner.
Yeah, I turned the pages
into toilet paper.
'Cause Brian's old now
and can't satisfy women
through intercourse.
Peter, I'm fine.
Are you sure
this isn't about you
not being able to perform
on your anniversary?
I told you that in confidence!
Whoa, slow down, buddy.
It's snack time,
not Black Friday.
Nobody's walking outta here
withFirst Wives Club
on Blu-ray, okay?
Nice as that sounds.
I heard there's a special
feature on the Blu-ray
that's just Diane Keaton
shrieking the commentary.
Huge, if true.
Actually, Stewie,
there's something important
I sorta need
to talk to you about.
Okay.
I recently found out
I have cooties.
And you're telling me why?
Well, I mean, uh...
remember last week?
When we ate from
the same Play-Doh?
("Bread and Butter"
by The Newbeats playing)
&#9834; He likes bread and butter &#9834;
&#9834; He likes toast and jam &#9834;
&#9834; That's what
his baby feeds him &#9834;
&#9834; He's her loving man &#9834;
&#9834; Well, I like
bread and butter &#9834;
&#9834; I like toast and jam. &#9834;
Stewie, listen.
I just think
you should get tested, okay?
What? You mean
I played with the Play-Doh
everyone you ever played
Play-Doh with played with?
I've been played!
Can I have a chocolate milk
with my snack today, please?
What? Honey, the chocolate milk
is the snack.
(doorbell rings)
Hey, Bonnie. Is Joe around?
No, he's on his stakeout.
Oh, that's too bad.
Tomorrow's Chris's Career Day,
and Joe's hat is a key element
of what I do.
So that's how I became
Quahog's first ninja cop.
- Questions?
- Yes.
- Mister--
- Officer Hi-yah.
Did you park in
the handicapped spot?
Ninjas don't have cars.
Well, it's gettin' towed.
Oh, no! My Chevy Cruze!
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
(running footsteps)
Man, something
smells good in here.
You cooking brussels sprouts?
No, I just farted.
That checks out.
Anyway,
somethin' else smells good.
I think dinner's ready.
I didn't hear a ding.
That's how I always know
to run into the kitchen,
shove a napkin in my shirt
and hold my utensils
upright at the table.
Well, I made it in the oven,
not the microwave.
You want a little taste?
Holy crap.
That's the best thing
I've ever had.
You know, I usually cook
for one-and-a-half,
but Joe's still on his stakeout.
You want to stay for dinner?
Ah, man, I'd love to,
but it'd be wrong.
I always eat dinner with Lois.
Aw, you sure?
You can sit in Joe's
dining harness if you like.
How's he get into that thing?
We have a large array
of medical-grade cranes
and pulleys that lift him.
- Man, that must make
the house ugly.
- It does.
(sighs) All right,
I guess I could text Lois.
But just this once.
Okay, we're good.
So, how long have you
had Invisalign?
- You can see it?
- Yeah, I mean,
it's just a name, not a fact.
Okay, Stewie, think positive.
The test results
will be negative.
Chin up, bud.
Incontinence is really not
that uncommon at your age.
What underwear do you recommend?
Depends. (laughs)
Sorry, old joke.
Now, get out of here
and go have some fun.
Make some fake skin
out of dried glue, would ya?
All right, who's next?
Oh.
Stewie. Come in.
Okay, I just want to verify
some medical history here.
Any recent boo-boos?
No.
Any ouchies or uh-ohs?
No, nothing like that. God.
Good, good.
And how many boogies
would you say
- you consume in a week?
- Oh, God, maybe, like... one.
Maybe two during the holidays.
Maybe.
Stewie, I'm your doctor.
I can tell
just by looking at you
that you're eating
more than that.
I'm thinking you had one
just on the way here.
What?
Okay, I did! I'm sorry.
I've just been so nervous
about these test results.
Well, that's understandable,
seeing as how you did
test positive for cooties.
What? That's terrible!
I think you need to get
your affairs in order.
I don't have any affairs!
I'm one!
Well, then you're ready to die.
(humming)
- Did you say something?
- Me?
No, just humming.
It's part of my alternative
cooties therapy.
Did you know you can
literally vibrate disease
out of the body?
No, I know the opposite of that.
Oh, Brian. You'll see.
When you get
this close to death,
your whole perspective changes.
I got your meds, honey.
My father never loved me,
but Stewie--
he take good care of me.
- Who was that?
- That's my 20-year-old nurse.
He's wearing homemade sandals.
Yeah, he has
no medical training.
Stewie, aren't you being
a little dramatic
about this cooties thing?
Brian, this is
the Flintstones cocktail
I have to take every day.
17 Barneys. 18 Wilmas.
I have to take the Bam-Bams
just to keep things moving.
Does this seem dramatic to you?
Yes, incredibly.
NURSE:
Stewie, I found one! Come look!
(sighs) He likes to find frogs
in the garden
and then show them to me.
His simplicity keeps me young.
Peter, what's wrong?
You don't have an appetite.
I'm gonna get one,
just give me a minute.
You've barely touched
your dinner.
Lois, the more
you talk about it,
the more it's gonna be
a whole thing.
Just let me focus here.
Okay, okay, that's working.
Mmm, oh, this is better, Bonnie.
Did you just call me Bonnie?
No! God-- God, no!
We all heard it, Dad.
Hey, Chris?
'Kay? Got it?
Well, what if I spiced it up
for you, Peter?
I-I think I saw
a take-out mustard packet
in the key drawer.
That's a water bed
for my army guy.
What if you spun
the plate around, Dad?
Tried it from behind?
Meg, go to place.
Ugh, do I have to?
I said "go to place"!
Anyway, Lois, I think
it's a non-starter tonight.
I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom,
look at pictures of barely-legal
Russian food on my iPad,
and then go to bed.
Okay, we're rolling.
Hi, I'm Tony Award winner
Stewie Griffin-Styles.
- What?
- It's called manifesting, Bri.
Anyway,
everything I have and own
is being left
to Rupert in a trust
for when he gets sober.
And no, Rupert, getting high
is not getting sober,
I don't care if you found
the one AA group in town
that tells you otherwise.
Brian, are you getting
my right angle?
You said you wanted it
from the left side.
- You want it from the right?
- (sighs)
The left angle is
the right side.
- Okay, back to one.
- (Brian sighs)
Stewie, you got a letter from
the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Oh, my God, they've
accepted my application!
I'm gonna get
my final wish granted!
I get to meet the Philadelphia
Flyer's mascot, Gritty!
Gritty, Gritty. Gritty.
I'm not going to pee in a cup
for you, so stop asking.
This was supposed to be my day
and you're ruining it.
(sighs)
You'll Venmo me for this,
too, I suppose?
(opera music playing)
Oh, Brian,
I'm glad you're here.
Me and a bunch of other
buff cooties victims
are gonna shut down
the third floor
of a Bloomingdale's tomorrow.
What do you think?
She's alive, right?
Stewie, come on,
this is ridic...
(music playing loudly)
Do you mind this music, Bri?
- Do you like opera?
- Not really.
Oh, Bri, you really haven't
heard "The Wheels on the Bus"
until you've heard it
in its original Italian.
&#9834; Le ruote del bus &#9834;
&#9834; Il turno &#9834;
&#9834; Il turno... &#9834;
- (music shuts off)
- Enough, Stewie!
You've taken this
whole thing too far.
I'm washing my hands
of your cooties.
Which, had you done
in the first place,
might have prevented all this.
You see, Rupert?
That's why I'm glad
you stopped drinking.
You were that ugly.
(doorbell rings)
BONNIE:
Yoo-hoo. Anyone home?
- I'll get it.
- No, I got it!
Aw, they sure do grow up fast,
don't they?
Chris, have you
masturbated today?
- No, ma'am.
- Well, get up there.
And don't come back
till you're...
What's for dinner?
What are you doing here?
My family's right inside.
I thought you might want
some lunch.
Joe's still on his stakeout
and I know you like
wagon-wheel pasta.
Of course I like
wagon-wheel pasta.
I'm an adult with
a developmental disorder.
(inhales)
Man, that smells good.
Okay, fine.
But, we gotta do this quick.
Right here against the wall.
Hey, Stewie, I wanted
to apologize for last night
and also maybe
charge my phone...
What the hell?
Hello, Brian.
If you're watching this,
it means you couldn't find
your phone charger
and came in to use mine.
Man, am I that predictable?
Yes. Yes, you are.
Anyway, I can see that
my disease has become a burden
to the people I love,
so I've decided
to take a bus to Vermont
to have
physician-assisted suicide.
- What?
- I've left two suits
in my closet,
and this is very important:
the black is for the wake,
the wool is for
the 'Gram story.
Two suits, Bri. Two looks.
That's what people
would expect of me.
Oh, my God. This is terrible.
Okay, don't look at the tags,
that's tacky.
Well, I'm not telling you that,
but not cheap.
I don't care about the suits!
Anyway, you were
a good friend, Bri.
Oh, and if they make
a movie about my life,
don't let Jim Carrey play me.
Unless he gets his eyes done.
Even then, though...
Ugh, hard maybe.
What have I done?
This is all my fault.
I drove my best friend away
and now he's alone
and dying on a bus somewhere.
Oh, also, you can have
my penis enlarging machine.
It's in my closet.
Ah! Did you look?
Will you-- will you text me
if you looked?
Hey, guys,
have you seen Stewie?
No. Have you checked
his Instagram?
Of course.
"Felt a little trepidation
about killing myself,
"so I went to a Phish show
in Burlington
to push me over the edge."
That's it.
He's in Burlington!
Thanks, Chris.
Long days,
short years, huh, Meg?
- LOIS: Chris! Masturbate!
- Jerk!
This is seriously the best
turkey I've ever had, Bonnie.
(vehicle approaching)
(gasps)
Looks like Joe's home early.
What? I ate most of his dinner!
He's gonna be so pissed.
I better hide.
Hey, Bon, did you know
there's a difference
between Tenth Street
and Tenth Avenue?
Anyway, I may have bonered
the stakeout.
Aw, thanks for
pre-chewing my meal, babe.
The food shuttles out of
my cloaca much easier that way.
Time to let these dogs
out of their cages.
Bon, would you turn
on my foot fan?
I gotta create a distraction
so I can get out of here.
(phone chimes)
Oh, God, Peter's texting me
about going to the Clam.
That guy is getting
insufferable.
And that dumb
Shaquille O'Neal GIF!
It's like, we get it,
it's humorous
for a man that large
to act playful.
I thought so.
So, anyway,
I'm gonna go dump all this
completely undigested food
out of my bag,
into the toilet.
If I time it right
and close my eyes,
it almost sounds like
real diarrhea.
This can never happen again,
Bonnie.
Time for a poignant,
cinematic farewell.
&#9834; &#9834;
(whispers) I don't like
when Bill Murray is serious.
&#9834; &#9834;
Hang tight, Stewie, I'm coming.
Is that--
is that Bernie Sanders?
Ha!
Goes to Vermont once.
Ah! How'd you get in here?
I was propelled
by a heart attack.
Now, let me talk about wages
while the corners of
my mouth fill with mung.
Are your glasses
always that smudged?
I haven't used a wipey cloth
in 35 years.
You know who uses wipey cloths?
Billionaires!
I-I'm sorry, I agree with
everything you say,
but can you just
say it softer?
Ooh, someone at Coachella must
have said my name three times.
Goodbye!
Wow, Lois, this smells amazing.
Yeah, it's eggs and garlic.
I microwaved them
till they were mixed.
Oh, oh, they're beautiful.
I love them.
Well, I'm just glad to see
you like my cooking
again, Peter.
What do you mean?
What other cooking would I like?
Bonnie's? You saying
I've been eatin' at Bonnie's?
Okay, fine, Lois! I've been
eatin' dinner at Bonnie's!
I think we should have
another baby.
That'll fix this.
Peter, I don't care.
You don't?
No, it's less food
for me to make
and besides, you know,
these things happen
in all marriages.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go
into the other room
and sing Melissa Manchester's
"Don't Cry Out Loud."
("Don't Cry Out Loud"
by Melissa Manchester begins)
No! No! Stop it! Stop it!
Nope! Nope! Can't afford it!
Well, what can we afford?
"Black Betty" by Ram Jam.
&#9834; Whoa, Black Betty &#9834;
&#9834; Bam-ba-lam,
whoa, Black Betty &#9834;
&#9834; Bam-ba-lam,
Black Betty had a child &#9834;
&#9834; Bam-ba-lam,
damn thing gone wild &#9834;
&#9834; Bam-ba-lam. &#9834;
Almost done, Stewie.
Do you have an email address
for our mailing list?
Uh, no thanks,
I'm about to kill myself.
Stop the procedure!
Look Stewie,
I know I've been hard on you,
but it's only because I've been
struggling with
my own mortality.
What?
But you're perfectly healthy.
Stewie, I celebrated
my tenth birthday this week.
In dog years, I'm 70.
It's all I can think about.
That's the age people shrug at
when they see it in an obituary.
Wait, T.O., you're 70?
Do you get regular peels?
You look great.
Yes, I've got
a great gal, we'll talk.
The point is,
I felt like my life was ending,
but I was wrong.
When I was driving up here
to the clinic,
I saw the leaves change.
I tapped a maple tree
and milked a cow.
I-I tried fresh cream
for the first time
and went to
a writer's retreat.
I met Margaret Atwood and
we foraged for wild mushrooms.
Wow, sounds like you were
in a real rush to get here.
The point is, I've got
a lot of life left in me,
and so do you.
Easy for you to say.
You don't have
a terminal illness.
Oh, for God's sake,
you don't have...
Brian, what are you doing?
Don't touch that!
That's the infected Play-Doh!
Brian, no! Stop!
There.
Now I have cooties, too.
And I don't care.
You... you don't?
We all have cooties,
whether it's illness
or loneliness or turning 70.
Nothing is promised.
We could get run over by a car.
Or struck by lightning.
We could be hit with
an unprecedented pandemic
that the government is
slow to recognize,
woefully unprepared for
and then mismanages
with reckless incompetence.
But that's all the more reason
to appreciate
the time we do have.
I mean, look around!
Look at this room.
It's beautiful.
Bri, did you eat
those mushrooms you found?
Yeah. You actually look like
a very old witch right now.
But I'm also just happy
to be alive...
and you should be, too.
You know what?
You're right, Brian.
Too bad you can never
get that on the page,
but that's profound.
Hey, I changed my mind.
I don't want
to do the procedure.
My life isn't over.
Why, I've only just begun.
("We've Only Just Begun"
by the Carpenters begins)
Stop it! Nope! Nope! Nope!
Can't afford it!
Well, what can we afford?
&#9834; Whoa, Black Betty,
bam-ba-lam &#9834;
&#9834; Whoa,
Black Betty, bam-ba-lam &#9834;
&#9834; Black Betty had a child,
bam-ba-lam &#9834;
&#9834; Damn thing gone wild,
bam-ba-lam. &#9834;
(indistinct chatter)
Yeah, you, first question.
Go ahead.
REPORTER:
Meg was noticeably absent
from the episode.
- Was that a team decision or...
- Yeah, I'm not going to be
answering
any questions about Meg.
We'll be dealing
with Meg internally.
- Over here.
- REPORTER 2: Do you think
we'll be seeing more of
Peter and Bonnie teaming up?
I thought it played
pretty well.
Uh, we'll have to look
at the tape on that
and, uh, make a decision
moving forward.
- Yeah.
- H. JON BENJAMIN: You guys used
to be on at 9:00,
now you're on at 9:30.
What happened with that?
All right, I'm done here.
This suit cost $40,000
and I'm throwing it away
after this press conference.
Okay, over here?
</div>\t'
