&#9834; It seems today
that all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in movies
and sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are those
good old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a man who
positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Where's Dad?
It's office birthdays today
at the brewery.

Ever since your father
was put in charge,
he's been taking it
very seriously.
Okay, Brian,
what do you got for me?
Okay, birthday jokes.
"We may be colleagues, but
there's no one in your league."
Boy, that's a brick
off the backboard.
Chris, what do you got?
"I drove the family
to Disneyland for vacation,
"and when we got off
the highway, the sign said,
'Disneyland, Left,'
so we drove back home."
Chris, that's going in the show.
See that, Brian?
Don't be afraid
to pull the heartstrings.
Peter, don't you think you might
be putting too much time

into office birthdays
and not enough into your job?
Come on, Lois. It's the one
thing I look forward to at work.
It's the one thing I'm good at.
I am to birthdays
what J.K. Rowling is
to now-problematic
wizard stories.
Perhaps Slytherin
or maybe Hufflepuff
or trans women
aren't really women.
Wait, what?
I mean, uh,
the first two things.
Okay, who's the next
girl or boy?
There's only those two.
Who's ready for June birthdays?
&#9834; June is bustin' out all over &#9834;
&#9834; Every birthday boy and girl
who's on the clock &#9834;
&#9834; First there's Annie
from accounting &#9834;
&#9834; Just turned 40,
but who's counting? &#9834;
&#9834; And that old guy Frank
down on the dock &#9834;
Ladies and gentlemen,
Leslie Uggams.
&#9834; June is bustin' out all over &#9834;
&#9834; Ah, tole, da, da-doe-da,
tinkin' can &#9834;
&#9834; All the hanna-manna wishes &#9834;
&#9834; And the hanna-wenna fishes &#9834;
&#9834; Out of all the morning glories
on the spam &#9834;
&#9834; Because it's June &#9834;
&#9834; Da-da-da &#9834;
&#9834; Just because it's June, June &#9834;
&#9834; June! &#9834;
Wait, isn't it November?
Who cares? They are marvelous.
So I drove my family
down to Disneyland for vacation.
When we got off the highway,
the sign said,
"Disneyland, Left,"
so we drove back home.
Thanks. I wrote that.
Oh, I'll show him.
I own the school paper.
Get me dirt
on Principal Shepherd's car.
I also own the school car wash.
Myeah. Myeah.
Children, please continue
independent play
while I go see
if I just sneezed my tampon out.
Let's see. Any good reads here?
Hmm, what's this?
Hmm.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
My word, this is brilliant.
Now to find my mark.
Hey, Stewie. What you reading?
Something with
different cloths to feel?
No, not since, uh...
not since COVID.
I say, Doug, it appears you've
got something on your shirt.
Is that so?
&#9834; &#9834;
Ha-ha!
There's nothing on your shirt!
It was all a ruse.
Doug, are you okay?
Oh, my God, what happened?
Who did this to you?
Stewie.
Stewart Griffin-Suarez,
is that true?
No!
And thank you for that.
Rupert and I
decided to hyphenate.
I hope it doesn't make me look
like too much of a pushover.
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.
Screw it.
Yes, I hit him.
And it was glorious.
This is
your third strike, Stewie.
That means no more time-outs.
You get a detention.
Detention?
You can't scare me.
The only thing that scares me
is a sudden loud noise,
even if it's only spoken.
We now return to Val Kilmer
and Robert Downey Jr.
-in Kiss Kiss...
Ooh!
...Bang Bang!
So, how did
the birthday thing go?
Amazing, Lois.
I've even been asked
to do a TED Talk.
What is a birthday?
I think it can best
be understood by breaking down
the word "birth" and "day."
Where the hell is everyone?
Ah, okay. Now it makes sense.
Bye-bye, Stewie.
Yeah, buh-bye, whatever.
Stewie, where are you headed?
You've got detention
this morning.
That's where I'm headed.
Stewie, no, detention
isn't in preschool.
It's in
the elementary school building.
The elementary school?
But that's where
the big kids are.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I ruins y'all's reveal?
Let me go ahead
and scooch back a little.
Beep, beep, beep.
Oh, no!
Look at that big scary school!
&#9834; &#9834;
My God, these kids
have their teeth.
And where are their pacifiers?
How do they ever sleep?
Detention kids are scary.
Especially that fourth grader
writing on the board.
Ah, that is such a load of
truth, a wonderful
load of truth.
All right, birthdays.
Whoop, whoop!
What the hell is this?
It's happy birthday
to you.
I didn't approve this.
Oh, yeah? Well, who the hell are
you-you?
I'm Preston Lloyd,
the new manager of the brewery
and your boss.
Is that true-true?
Yes. And I've been charged with
improving brewery productivity.
And it has become clear to me
that the best way to start is
by canceling office birthdays,
effective immediately.
I don't know how to stop
on roller skates,
so hang on until
I run out of momentum.
What?!
But, Mr. Lloyd, you can't
cancel office birthdays.
I'm pretty sure I can.
Mr. Griffin, I like
focused, productive employees.
But this is a brewery.
Beer is supposed to be fun.
I've been sober for 46 years.
How old are you?
46.
A brewery is not about
getting drunk.
It's a business.
I need disciplined,
productive employees.
Can you be that, Mr. Griffin?
Oh, heavens, no.
Then we're going to have
a problem.
But, Mr. Lloyd, you can't
take away office birthdays.
People love 'em.
If it means that much
to the employees, fine.
Yay!
I'll do them.
Aw.
Attention, employees.
This is Mr. Lloyd, your manager.
I will now resume
the office birthday celebration
from earlier.
Helen Daily, date of birth
12/10/1968.
Martin Burke, date of birth
12/13/1969.
J.H. Christ, 12/25...
zero, zero, zero, zero.
You now have two minutes
to consume cake.
Hey, do you know where I can
get a pacifier in this place?
I'm jonesing.
Anyone hears you
say that in here,
you'll get your ass kicked.
You're the "something
on your shirt" kid, right?
How did you know?
Well, I make it
my business to know.
You got purdy lips.
Why, thank you.
It's a new serum.
Move over, lip balms.
The secret is retinol.
Let's talk later.
I can't believe
the new jerk manager
canceled office birthdays.
It was the one thing in life
I looked forward to.
Is this manager
a no-nonsense, button-down man
who's also been in the military?
How'd you know?
Mm-hmm.
Well, what do I do?
Take it from a lawman,
whenever authorities have tried
to take away something
the people find precious,
the people have found ways
around the law.
They always find a way,
like nature.
Look at that.
Tree bent to keep growing
toward the sun.
Anyway, I'm Joe,
and I don't do a lot of these.
Boy, wouldn't you like to know
what those little guys
are saying?
&#9834; &#9834;
What's the password?
"Fat man."
I'd like to wish
all you birthday boys and girls
a special day
with the help of...
The Beatles.
One, two, three, hit it.
The boss is coming.
And this is our final stop
on the tour.
What's this room?
Oh, this is
an unused meeting room
that no one pays attention to.
Ah. Well, then,
I suppose there's no need
to pay any attention.
Okay, there was an elderly
Jewish family hiding in there,
and I don't know
what to tell them.
Well, Stewie, you've completed
your detention.
What have you learned
from this experience?
That your mother's a whore.
Hey, Stewie.
How was your detention?
Brian Griffin,
is that really you?
Been a long time, it has.
I saw you this morning.
The world's gone and got itself
in a big damn hurry.
You lose track of time
on the inside, Brian.
You wouldn't know.
You ain't seen
the things I've seen.
Preschool detention?
No, I guess I haven't.
What'd you do in there?
Got jacked.
You look exactly the same.
And yet I got jacked.
Okay, time to make
this office my own
and decorate it
with my prized achievements.
Ah, let's start with
my Big Mouth Billy Bass
with the battery removed
so I don't have to be
interrupted by that nonsense.
Ah, my framed ticket stub
from opening night of
Independence Day.
My Purple Heart.
Today, for
a special birthdays treat,
I've acquired Marty McFly's amp.
Who's ready to rock birthdays?
There.
A lifetime of
fragilely framed achievements.
What the hell?
Mr. Lloyd!
What is going on in here?
Ow! Ow! Aah!
Sorry.
Aah! That didn't work!
Ow, my bones!
I had a very good rotation guy
work on this.
Ow, though!
Ow! Please stop!
Sorry. Sorry.
I-I don't know what to say.
I'll call the guy. I-I don't
know, I don't know what to say.
Griffin, is this some kind of
secret birthday
celebration room?
I made a decision
to cancel office birthdays,
and it was very explicit.
There was nudity?
Mr. Griffin, you leave me
no other choice.
You're fired.
Fired?
Can I still get paid
and just not come?
No.
Well, I guess
it's time to say goodbye
to the security guards
whose names I never learned.
Take care, Cap'n.
Stay golden, Chief.
Be well, Buckaroo.
Bye,
Francesca Louise Allessandro.
Say hi to Max and Samuel
and your sister Eloise for me.
And good luck
with your night courses.
Hey, do you have, like,
a nickname on Instagram?
I'm having trouble finding you.
I can't believe you were fired
from the brewery.
I mean, how are we gonna
pay our bills?
That depends.
When you use Venmo,
do they just, like,
believe you
that you have the money?
No.
Right?
No.
Fine. Maybe they'll take me back
as the Radio City Rockette
with too-big shoes.
Shoes!
Shoes!
Should we just get him
smaller shoes?
Wouldn't matter.
He butters his feet.
Stewie, breakfast!
When did this new slab of beef
get delivered?
My name's Chris.
You don't have a name
until I give you one.
You're a little young and plump
to be in a place like this.
You need a friend.
Someone who can provide you
with protection.
I could be your friend.
All we'll need is
a BIC pen and a lighter.
Why? So you can burn
a swastika into my butt?
Well, you just ruined
the surprise, you goofball.
Oh. Stewie.
What brings you by?
You're gonna give me
what I want.
Um, wh-what are you
talking about?
You know.
We're doing this, and you're
gonna find a way to enjoy it.
I-I don't like it.
I don't understand
what's happening.
The three sisters have
a magic hopscotch board
that turns them
into superheroes,
but only at night
and never if it's raining.
It's too complicated and noisy.
Yeah, it is
both of those things.
And their cat speaks French.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, there you are, Rupert.
Funny how I never got
a visit in detention.
Not even a letter.
What do you mean
you couldn't find a stamp?
Well, no need to mail it now.
Show me the letter.
Show me the damn letter!
I met a new friend in detention.
His name is
Thomas the Shank Engine.
I think it's time you two met.
You want to meet him?
What's going on in here?
You don't know
what detention was like, Brian.
I feel like I aged
four years in there.
On the first day, an older boy
put two fingers on my nose
and just took it right off my
face and held it in front of me
and said, "I got it.
I got your nose."
That ever happen to you, Brian?
You ever seen your own nose
wiggling between two fingers
right in front of your face?
And he never gave it back.
Stewie, what's going on
in here?
Okay, you are coming with me.
They've got my nose, Brian.
They've got my nose.
They've got my--
Ah.
This changes everything.
Ooh, bubbles!
Aw, looks like somebody was
overdue for his bath time.
That's why you've been
so cranky.
All right, after this, we'll get
you into your footsie jammies
and tucked into bed.
Ah, finally, I can put
that whole detention experience
behind me and just live.
Whoa.
Yep, so that's how your granddad
got his back tattoo
and hepatitis.
Never share a needle
with Ben Affleck.
How did you
and Other Granddaddy meet?
That's a story
for when you're older.
The kids at school were asking
if you're a bottom or a top.
They should not be asking that.
They said if that was your
answer, then you were a bottom.
Who are these kids
you're talking to?
I would like to have a word
with their attractive fathers.
And that's how you say
"productivity"
in 11 different languages,
which, in hindsight, was not
a productive use of time.
Oh, sorry to interrupt.
I just came to clear the
search history off my computer
before the I.T. guy--
uhp, he's already got it.
Boy, you're really all in
on Asa Akira.
Way off, pal. This is
the only place I can masturbate.
Griffin, just go.
&#9834; &#9834;
Oh, fat man, my fat man.
Mr. Pabian.
Get down from there at once.
&#9834; &#9834;
Oh, fat man, my fat man.
Ms. Towers, get down.
Do you hear me?
I order you to get down.
Oh, fat man, my fat man.
Get down! Every one of you.
That is a direct order.
Do you hear me?
Oh, fat man, my fat man.
Oh, fat man,
my fat man.
Oh...
Thank you all. Thank you.
As someone
who doesn't remember movies,
I've never seen such an original
display of faith in a colleague.
Peter, you're rehired.
Really?
Griffin, I guess I've learned
that employees are
willing to endure a crappy job,
low pay, meaningless work,
no upward mobility,
laughable benefits packages,
countless OSHA violations,
exposure to hazardous waste
and emotional abuse
as long as there are balloons
and pieces of cake once a month.
I guess I can allow that.
And I've learned that every
office needs a worst employee
that all the other employees
can look down on.
I can be that.
I can be that guy.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Hey-hey,
Francesca Louise Allessandro!
Good news.
I found your Instagram.
Did you see the 90 photos
I liked in a row
last night at 2:00 a.m.?
Also, who's @BeckyFitness96, and
can you tell her to unblock me?
Well, Peter, I'm glad
you got your job back.
Me, too, Lois,
but I am gonna miss
getting to perform every week.
You don't need to be in charge
of birthdays to perform.
You know, you're right, Chris.
&#9834; June is bustin' out all over &#9834;
&#9834; It's birthdays
and na-na-na-na-na &#9834;
&#9834; And a zabba... &#9834;
Oh, my! Tony Award-winning
performer Leslie Uggams?
What are you doing here?
I heard you were
singing my song,
but I think
you got the words wrong.
It isn't "hana-wanna-dada-baba."
It's "da-zalway-da-da-zee-za."
Oh, oh, okay.
And then is it, uh,
something about Nash Bridges?
No, it's "all the little bit
of dridges."
Ah, "little bit of dridges,"
of course.
Now you got it!
Come on!
&#9834; June is bustin' out all over &#9834;
&#9834; All over
the meadow and the hill &#9834;
&#9834; And da-zalway-da-da-zee-za &#9834;
&#9834; All the little bit
of dridges &#9834;
&#9834; And the morning glories
and the fez &#9834;
&#9834; Because it's June &#9834;
&#9834; June, June, June &#9834;
&#9834; Bustin' out, it's June, June &#9834;
&#9834; June! &#9834;
Bravo!
That's from the 1945 Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical
Carousel, about
carousel barker Billy Bigelow,
whose romance with
mill worker Julie Jordan
comes at the price
of both their jobs.
If you want to know more
about it, ask your grandfather,
who was dragged
to see it on a date
and then had to get married
to touch boob.
