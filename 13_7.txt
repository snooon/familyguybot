&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;

&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
ANNOUNCER:You are watching Amazon Prime,

Amazon Prime-- likethe eighth best way to watch TV.
Hi, Chris, howwas school?
Wait, what's that notepinned to your backpack?
Bet it's from a girlin the lunchroom
who wants a tasteof corn dog.
Was that a sex joke?
It's...
I don't know,shut up.
Oh, dear, it's fromPrincipal Shepherd.
Peter, he wants to see usfirst thing tomorrow.
Oh, Chris isin trouble.
Sounds like he needs alittle fatherly wisdom.
Better get my pipe.
Peter, I think that'sthe wrong kind of pipe.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I haven't been doingtoo great in school lately.
Well, that'svery disappointing.
I guess your father and I willhave to talk to the principal
and figure outhow to handle this.
Ah, I wouldn'tworry, Lois.
I never did very wellin school either.
I even failedhomeroom.
Peter Griffin?
There.
Thank you for coming,Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
Chris seems to bestruggling in his classes,
and often when kidshave trouble in school,
it's because somethingis going on at home.
I haven't been attracted to Loisfor a year and a half.
Principal Shepherd, exactlyhow poorly is Chris doing?
Well, right now,he has a D-minus average.
His only hope ishis history final tomorrow.
If he fails that,
I'm afraid he'll haveto repeat ninth grade.
This... seems morelike a phone call.
Oh, my God.
I always knew Chris wasn'ta great student,
but I had no ideathe situation was so dire.
Don't worry, I'll makesure Chris passes history.
You can count on me.
The same way NASA counted on meduring the Apollo 13 crisis.
All right, I'm gonnaneed three coffins--
mahogany withbrass handles--
three new daddies for thedead astronauts' kids
and a blacksuit for me.
Sir, I think I know a waywe can get them back.
Is it hard?
It might be.
Yeah, we-we've kindof already decided
we're going inthis direction.
All right, Chris,you got a lot riding
on this historyexam tomorrow.
I know.
Sam Cooke didn'tknow much about history,
and he got shot in a hotel
wearing nothingbut a sports coat and a shoe.
Yeah, that's hilarious, Chris,but we've got to buckle down.
Now, I'm gonna help you studyby nailing your door shut.
That way, you'll have nochoice but to hit the books.
(hammering)
(cell phone buzzes)Oh, crap, I leftmy phone in there.
(jiggles handle) Damnit, it's nailed shut.
(cell phone whooshes)Dad, it looks likesome girl sent you
a picture of her privates.
Oh, crap! Lois!I don't have the phone!
Stop sending pictures!
LOIS:I already sent four more!
(cell phone whooshing)
Chris, put down the phone!Don't look at those!
Wait a minute,that's both her hands!
Who the hell istaking the pictures?!
All right, give me thatphone and get back to work.
And before youjudge your mother--
you did mostof that damage.
(sighing):Oh.
Hey, Chris.
Just wanted to seehow the studying's going.
You guys, I've beenat this all night,
and I haven'tlearned a thing.
There's no way I'm gonna passMr. Harpington's history test.
Oh, come on, Chris.
I'm sure that'sjust the nerves talking.
Here, I'll quiz you.
Who said, "We have nothingto fear but fear itself"?
Scooby-Doo?
No.Shaggy?
It's nobody on Scooby-Doo.
Wow, Chris,you, uh...
you really don'tknow history.
I know.
And if I fail ninth grade,I won't amount to anything.
I'll end up beingone of those bus drivers
that parents don'tcompletely trust.
You have a beautifulchild, Mrs. Roberts.
God, poor Chris.
He's studying as hard as he can,but it doesn't seem to matter.
Well, we got todo something.
If he doesn't pass thistest, he's gonna have to...
Hey.
...he's gonna have torepeat ninth grade.
Well, there's not muchwe can do about it.
Some people just aren't ableto learn from books.
Well, maybe hedoesn't have to.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a way
to actually showChris history...
with my time machine.
You know, that's reallynice of you, Stewie.
Well, he's my brother.
We've got tostick together.
Like that two-headedgirl on TLC.
Okay, who wants to taste it,and who wants to smell it?
All right, we'll justtell Chris he's dreaming,
because I don't want himto know about my time machine.
Why not?
Eh, it's like havinga pickup truck.
Once people know you got one,there go your weekends.
Chris?
Can you hear me?
Huh?
You're dreaming.
I'm dreaming?
Yay! No consequences!
(screams)
So lifelike!
(sighs) All right, let's go backsix minutes and try this again.
Chris, you're dreamingwith consequences.
What?
That's right.
We're gonna take you ona special dream trip
to help you passyour history test.
You are?
Yes, and there'sso much to learn.
For example, did you know
that Jesus didn't reallydie on the cross?
So, what was thecause of death?
Cocaine and severe traumato the colon.
Yeah, I'm gonna needto see those forms.
Don't look at me like that.
Babe, I told you,it's a business trip.
All right,I've got the return pad,
and the time machine ispowering up right now.
We should be leaving any moment.
This thing is awesome.
Stewie, can you believeBrian built this?
Wait, what?
(chuckling):Oh, hey, come on, guys.
"Who built what"is not a question
on the historyfinal, right?
Good point, Brian.
That's why victoryis always Brian's.
You dick!
How much of my stuffhave you taken credit for?!
Hey, everybody?
Just so you know,I'm straight.
All right, Chris, Ireviewed your textbook,
and I've programmed a tour ofthe various historical events
that you'll need toknow for your exam.
So, pay closeattention.
First stop--Washington, D.C.
The year is 1803.
Ah, the future.
Now, the man at the podiumis Thomas Jefferson.
And this is a veryimportant moment.
He's tryingto convince Congress
to approvethe Louisiana Purchase.
Come on, guys!
We're getting Oklahoma,Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas,
Wyoming, North Dakota,South Dakota and Louisiana.
What are the chancesall those states suck?
STEWIE:This is Paris, 1920.
This bar is where famousAmerican writers,
like Ernest Hemingway,would go for a drink.
Oh, my God,there he is!
Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway,can I have a beer with you?
Sure!
I love lifeand all the people in it!
Thanks.
And, hey, as afellow writer,
I would love to talkto you about the craft.
I mean, God, if only we couldget rid of these damn arms
and attach the pen directlyto the heart, right?
You guys,I got his pen!
Now, Chris,this is Brazil
before the inventionof the soccer ball.
Australia beforethe shark-tooth necklace.
And Italybefore pasta.
Ay!Oh!
Vowel sound!
They were alwaysa ridiculous people.
Hey, Family Guy, you're luckyI got a manicotti in the oven,
or I'd bash your faceinto a bolognese.
That's two kinds of food.
That's how angry I am.
(screams)
CHRIS:Oh, my God!
Where are we?!
Omaha Beach, 1944.
This is D-Day.
What's that over there?
Oh, that'sDouble D-Day.
&#9834; She's my cherry pie &#9834;
&#9834; Cool drink of water,such a sweet surprise &#9834;
&#9834; Tastes so good... &#9834;
Nein, nein! Nofire! Ist gut!
Heil hooters!
Be careful.
It could bea booby trap!
(laughing):Oh, Otto.
Here we are.
Christmas night, 1776.
The father of our nation,George Washington,
is about to boldlycross the Delaware.
What's on his arms?
Those are water wings.
He was terrifiedof the water.
Easy!
All right, Chris,it's 1798,
and we're in the homeof Jane Austen.
Jane Austen?
I don't think she'son my history test, Stewie.
Oh, I know--we're just here
to release pent-uptime-travel farts.
Awesome!Yeah!
(farting)
(sniffing)
Aw, yeah!
Give me some of that!
Mmm, the insidesof men!
This is whatfuels me!
(sniffing)
Mmm!
Okay, time for somerecent history.
This is the 1990s.
&#9834; And I'll tell myselfI'm over you... &#9834;
This isthe entire 1990s?
Yes.
Wait a minute.
Pre-Soviet Russia?
This wasn'ton the manifest.
Yeah, this is kindof a personal thing.
Hey, Pavlov, youdog-teasing dick!
How's this for positivereinforcement?!
All right,where to next?
I want to killmore scientists!
All right, Chris,
that was the BritishParliament, 1912.
Next, we...
I say, that looks like ayoung Charlie Chaplin.
Sir, please, take this money anduse it to pursue your dreams.
Danke.
Stewie, I thinkthat was a young Hitler.
You just gave moneyto Hitler!
Yeah, but before allthe crazy stuff.
All right, Chris, let's discusswhat you've learned so far.
Now, what is your biggesttakeaway from our travels?
That you can't take a good napwith keys in your pocket.
For God's sake, Chris!
You clearly have notpaid attention
to anything we've shown you!
You're absolutely hopeless!
Did you ever considerthe reason you're having trouble
passing ninth grade isthat you're incapable
of anything else?!
That this is the absolute zenithof your ability?!
Zenith means top.
No, it means TV.
Ha! Now I'm catching fire.
Damn it, Chris, your problemisn't book learning,
it's that you're a moron!
This whole trip has beena complete waste of time!
Screw you, Stewie.
You're a jerk!
And I'm gonna win that bowlingtournament, with or without you!
(sobs)
What is he... what?
He-he doesn't even know whatwe're preparing him for!
STEWIE:Chris?
Chris, come back!
Well, we've lookedall over London.
He's nowhere.
I don't know what thehell we're going to do.
CHRIS:Hey, Stewie!
If I'm such a moron, then howdid I get on a fancy boat?!
(horn bellows)
See you later, douche bags!
Oh, crap!
Chris ison the Titanic?!
No, no, it'sokay, Brian.
We'll just go back in timeto before Chris ran off.
Oh, and I tookyour fancy smoke detector!
(gasps)
My God, he's gotthe return pad!
Brian, we've got toget on that ship!
PURSER:Attention, passengers.
The karaoke contestwill begin in five minutes.
Okay, now we've reallygot to get on that ship.
Brian, we haveto get on that ship!
It's our only hopeto save Chris.
There! Jump ontothat mooring rope.
We can use itto pull ourselves up.
Oh, thank God, I wasn'tsure we were gonna make it.
I wasn't worried.
I've faced biggerchallenges.
Like trying to dressJonah Hill for the Oscars.
Okay, okay, perfect.
Tell him to stayexactly that weight.
(cell phone rings)
Yes?
(sighs)Damn it!
Oh, my God, Brian.
This ship, it's...it's unbelievable.
It's even more magnificentthan I imagined.
That, Brian.
That.
That's what I wastelling you about.
That's brocade.
Come on, Stewie, we gotto find Chris and the return pad
before it's too late.
All right,let's split up.
I'll go searchin first class,
you go downto steerage
and wade through thegross Irish and Italians.
That's two.
Ugh, God knows whatI'm gonna find in steerage.
Bunch of drunk, fat,pie-faced Irish fools.
Excuse me, have any of you seena blond teenage boy?
Who's asking?
Yeah, who the hell are you?
And I'm the baby!
Chris?
What the hell?
Stewie,what are you doing?
Uh, dining at thecaptain's table.
Everyone at this tablewas the first person
to refrigeratesomething.
I refrigerated shoes.
Because everybodylikes a cool toe.
Also, I gave the stringquartet the sheet music
for "Highway tothe Danger Zone."
You have the sheet music for"Highway to the Danger Zone"?
Uh, yeah.
What do you think Ikeep in this backpack?
It's all PowerBarsand sheet music.
Stewie, you're supposedto be looking for Chris.
I did-- he wasn'tin the Turkish bath,
the veranda caf&#233; or theBloody Handkerchief Ball.
Oh, dear.
Relax, Brian, I thinkI see Chris right now.
Really? Where?
I'm gonna go aheadand bet he's the guy
with the whole chickenstuck on his head.
(muffled mumbling)
Hey, you're not Chris.
Pardon me,that's my hat!
(muffled mumbling)
I know this thing's gonna sink,but I'm having a good time.
(Chris laughing)
Stewie, look!
(laughing)
Chris, there you are!
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Booger Breathand the Mushroom Tip.
Wh-Which oneof us is which?
Chris, we have gotto get off this boat.
The Titanic was one of thebiggest disasters in history.
Well, if you'reso worried,
why don't you alertthe crew and save everyone?
Because, Chris,we can't alter the past.
That's the first rule of...
of, uh... uh, dreaming.
Besides, savingthis ship would mean
talking to, like, 80 people,
and I-I'm just notin that kind of mood right now.
Look, Chris, just giveus that thing you took
so we canall get home.
(all screaming)
Quick, Chris,Stewie, get on!
To home!
Or I'll just put inthe coordinates.
Damn!
The return pad!
It's been destroyed!
What?!
The whole thing's beenwaterlogged!
I'll need to dry it outand completely rewire it.
This would makea great movie.
And the parts I needto fix the return pad
certainly aren'ton this ship.
We have to somehowget to dry land.
Dry land?!
Stewie, almost everyoneon the Titanic died!
All right,calm down, Brian.
No-- there's so muchI haven't done.
I've never evensuccessfully made love
to a woman inthe shower.
BRIAN:Aah, my back!
WOMAN: Should I put myfoot in the soap dish?
Yeah, try that, and maybestand on your tippy-toes.
Aah, how does watermake it dry?!
(panicked screaming)
This isn't gonna work.
Brian, this isour only hope.
The majorityof people
who got on those lifeboatswere women of noble birth.
Now, I've givenus all backstories.
I am Lady AntoniaTyler Carrington,
the Duchess of Lancashire, theheir to the Earl of Portsmouth,
and the cousinof the Countess of Wessex.
Okay, great. And who are we?
I don't know,you're just two sluts with me.
Hey, there's a lifeboat.
Uh, yeah,but it's got one
of those funny Southwestlifeboat attendants.
Hey,here's a reminder--
as you exit the boat,
don't forget to give usyour extra snacks
because as you know,we work for peanuts!
(laughs heartily)
That's refreshing.
Most of those guysare all serious.
(clamoring)
There, that one!
It's our last chance.
(playing "Danger Zone")
Hey, they learned it!
What a bunch of pros.
(clamoring)
Hello there, sir.
We are three noblewomenin distress...
Sorry, boat's full.
Um, what if one of us wereto turn this big ship
into a "tug" boat? (laughs)
Wink, wink.
Wouldn't help you.
You're the fourth personto offer that,
and I'm kind of spent.
I don't believe this.
Dear God,we're stuck here.
We're going to drownon the Titanic.
Oh, no, we're not.
Hey! I saidyou can't come on here.
Get out of my way,you son of a bitch!
(screams)
Oh, no!
I can't swim withoutmy striped one-piece!
Everyone move over.
We're getting on this boat.
Please take my baby!
Yeah, I'm sorry,if I take your baby,
I'm gonna haveto take everyone's baby.
Can you believethat woman?
Putting me on the spotin front of everyone.
(passengers screaming)
To home!
You see whatyou started?
Wow, Chris.
You just savedour lives.
Thank you.
Oh, it wasnothing, Brian.
Listen, Chris,I, um...
I think I oweyou an apology.
I'm not someonewho often makes mistakes,
but, well, I was wrong earlierwhen I called you a moron.
No, you were right.
You're the smart one in thefamily, and I'm the dumb one.
Oh, you're being toohard on yourself.
Look, you may not be"book smart" or "history smart,"
but you're "throw peopleoff the boat" smart.
And, frankly,I'm starting to think
that's the best kind to be.
Thanks, Stewie.
Well, looks likeone ship was saved today--
a relation-ship.
Oh, thank God,we're back.
Wow, what anadventure!
Thanks, Dream Brian.
Thanks, Dream Stewie.
Brian, Stewie!
I just had the mostamazing dream.
I was on a famous boatcalled the Gigantic.
Yeah, he's gonna failthat test tomorrow.
Well, we gave it ourbest shot, Stewie.
It was still a nice thingyou did for your brother.
I suppose.
I just hope that Chriskilling one extra man
on the Titanic didn't alteranything in the present.
There he is.
"Nigel Harpington."
Wait, "Harpington"?
Isn't that the name ofChris's history teacher?
Yes, I thinkyou're right.
That must behis ancestor.
Which means that Chris'shistory teacher was never born.
Hey, everybody,I'm Teacher Doug,
and I don't believein tests.
Yay! </div>\t'
