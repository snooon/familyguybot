 ? Is violence in movies 
 and sex on TV ? 
? But where are those 
 good old-fashioned values ? 
? On which we used to rely? ? 
? Lucky there's a family guy ? 
? Lucky there's a man who 
 positively can do ? 
? All the things that make us ?
? Laugh and cry ? 
? He's... a... 
 Fam... ily... Guy! ? 
Well, here we are. 
Time for everyone 
 to get new shoes. 
Hi. Can I help you 
 find something? 

What's she gonna do? 
This place doesn't even 
 have a back room. 
All the inventory's 
 just out on the floor 
in ceiling-high library stacks.
Yup, we got it, Stewie. 
 You're better than this place. 
Yeah, I know that. 
 I'm better than every place. 
Yes, my son needs 
 a new pair of shoes. 
Okay, let's just 
 see what his size is. 
Looks like a ten and a half. 
They're perfect. I'll take 'em.
No, those aren't the shoes. 
(robotic): Do not speak 
 in that tone to the Iron Giant.
Must destroy shoebox city. 
Sorry. 
 He's a little out of sorts.

He saw a bra in the window 
 of Lane Bryant on the way over.
They're, um... 
 they're pretty big. 
They are a remarkable feat 
 of engineering. 
That and the Ferris wheel 
 I will never understand. 
Yeah, for me, it's paper bags. 
I mean, there's a door 
 in it, but no exit? 
-What's that about? 
 -(laughs) 
I was serious about the bag, 
 but, hi. 
-I'm Brian. 
 -Holly. 
Holly... are you free 
 on Friday night? 
Well, I don't know. 
 Are you a shoe store murderer? 
N-N-No. 
There's more than you'd think. 
Like, if you were me, that's not
a ridiculous question. 
See you Friday. 
Good for you, Brian. 
Maybe you can take her 
 to the Cheesecake Factory. 
People seem to like that place.
Did you folks find something 
 on the menu you'd like? 
No. 110 pages, and no. 
? ? 
-What's all this? 
 -Oh, hey, guys. 
Uh, sadly, my Uncle Ray 
 passed away last week, 
but he left me 
 his vintage sports car. 
Joe, that's amazing 
 that your uncle died. 
But I'm really sorry 
 to hear about the car. 
He means that 
 the other way around. 
Uncle Ray also left 
 strict instructions 
for me to show his car 
 at the Classic Car Show 
in Providence this weekend. 
Classic Car Show? 
Isn't that one 
 of those gatherings 
of a bunch of guys 
 whose penises don't work? 
Correct. Anyone with 
a perfectly-restored classic car
for sure has a bum wiener. 
Uh, he also left me 
 everything I'd need 
to convert my garage 
 to a 1950s-style diner. 
See, here are all the 1950s 
 Coke signs from the 1980s. 
Oh, cool, and a jukebox! 
Yeah, but since the songs 
 are from the '50s 
they're all about men 
 in their 40s 
wanting to have sex 
 with teenagers. 
? I wanna... 
 be-bop a teeny bopper ? 
? At the sock hop ? 
? Or maybe after work 
 behind the malt shop... ? 
(new 1950s song intro begins) 
? 13 candles ? 
? Is probably enough... ? 
? Nine, ten, 11-year-old, 
 12-year-old sex ? 
? I'm gonna sleep 
 with all the kids tonight! ? 
Joe, stop pressing buttons. 
("Somethin' Stupid" 
 playing in distance) 
? And then I go 
 and spoil it all ? 
? By saying somethin' stupid ? 
? Like "I love you." ? 
(scattered applause) 
Boy, I forgot 
 how great that song is. 
I know, right? It's definitely 
 my favorite romantic love song 
sung by a father 
 to his daughter. 
Ooh, we should 
 put in our next song. 
Good thinking. 
Yes, we'd like 
 to request "Witchcraft," 
as arranged 
 by Mr. Nelson Riddle. 
(sighs) 
 Okay, give me a minute. 
You should just know 
there's a 21st 
 birthday party here, 
and you're ruining it for them.
Wow. 
 3:00 a.m. 
We practically 
 shut the place down. 
And quite a night. 
 We got to sing two songs. 
Do you mind if I kiss you? 
Actually, I should 
 chew some gum first. 
I had bologna for dinner. 
Get over here. 
(both moaning) 
Oh, yeah, 
 that's good kiss bologna. 
Oh, hey, guys, 
 what's the word? 
Uh, bird. 
 Bird is the word. 
But we were wondering 
 if you'd take us 
for a spin in your new car. 
Yeah, that's a great idea. 
 Hop in. 
Vroom! Vroom! 
 Vroom! Vroom! 
(imitates clicking, 
 engine revving) 
(imitates gear shifting) 
Uh, what-what... 
 what's happening right now? 
Close your eyes, gang, as we hit
the Kancamagus Highway. 
Just four miles 
 to Mount Washington. 
What the hell 
 are you doing, Joe? 
We want to go for a real drive.
This is a real drive. 
 Just imagine it. 
Feel that New Hampshire air. 
Joe, we're not in New Hampshire.
We're in your driveway. 
Oh, great, some knucklehead 
 is tailgating us. 
What's the hurry, pal? 
Oh, I see so many birds. 
Well, we're in a tunnel, so I'm
 not sure how that's possible. 
Joe, stop this car right now. 
-The car is stopped. 
 -(imitates gears grinding) 
(sighs) Always have trouble 
 finding third. 
(imitates brake squeaking) 
 Okay, what's up? 
You got this amazing car. 
 Why can't we take it out? 
Well, ever since I was nine, 
I've dreamed 
 of driving this car someday. 
But I'm not allowed. 
 It's in my uncle's will. 
Even when I take it 
 to the car show, 
I have to put it up 
 on a trailer. 
Malcolm in the Middle, 
 five nights a week 
on Manchester's Channel 12. 
Cleveland, stop reading 
 fake billboards. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I'm off to taste the delights 
 of downtown Nashua. 
I don't care what Joe says. 
This is too nice a car 
 not to drive it. 
Are you suggesting we take it 
 out without telling Joe? 
He's left us no choice. 
I can't just sit in a car 
 and pretend to drive, 
like-like I had to pretend 
 to be impressed 
by Quagmire's 
 new big, green grill. 
This is the largest 
 high-performance 
ceramic cooker available, Peter.
-NSF Certified. 
 -Ah, yeah, cool. 
I'm starving. When do we... 
 when do we fire this thing up? 
(laughing): 
 Fire-fire this thing up? 
Get a load of this guy. 
 You don't just fire it up. 
You slowly bring it 
 to temperature. 
(sighs) 
 Okay. 
When do we put the burgers on? 
B-B-Burgers? 
 Are you hearing this? 
You don't put burgers on a grill
of this quality, Peter. 
I've been brining a heritage 
 breed chicken for three days. 
(sighs) 
 Then can we put that on? 
Yes. At midnight, 
 when it's reached temperature. 
Then why am I here now? 
Because I need your help 
to move the grill a single inch.
(both grunting) 
(sighs) 
Well, let's just listen to music
on my high-end stereo system. 
Nice. 
 Let's crank it. 
(laughing): 
 C-C-Crank it? 
You hear this clown? 
I only use it 
 to listen to podcasts. 
MAN: 
 Today on The Moth, 
how a single pair of shoes 
 reunited two sisters. 
So, big date, huh? 
You must really like this girl.
Honestly, I think 
 Holly could be... the one. 
Brian, you strike me 
 as a very selfless lover. 
Is that true? 
 Are you a selfless lover? 
Stop saying "selfless lover." 
Have you been reading 
 Lois' romance novels again? 
A few, 
 but I'm just saying I bet 
your coital congress will send 
Holly into paroxysms of ecstasy.
-Knock it off. 
 -What? I'm being supportive. 
After all, 
 confidence will help you 
maintain optimal stamina 
 during your lovemaking. 
-That's enough. 
 -Have it your way, Brian. 
I myself am a student 
 of the pleasures of the flesh. 
(slurping) 
Listen to your lover, Brian. 
(stomach gurgling) 
Ugh, damn it. 
 Anxiety dump. 
(stomach gurgling) 
-(unzips) 
 -Ah, that's better. 
Oh, uh, is-is Holly here? 
You must be the new jerk 
 my mom is dating. 
Uh, and you must be the kid 
she never told me about. 
I host Family Guy repeats 
 in Germany. 
GERMAN ANNOUNCER: German 
 Family Guy is brought to you 
by rail-thin men 
 in Internet pornos going, 
"Ooh-aah, ooh-aah, ooh-aah!" 
I'm sorry I never 
 told you I had a son. 
Some guys get scared off. 
No, no, that-that's great. 
I'm-I'm terrific with kids. 
I actually have a kid. 
Aw, that's sweet. 
 How old is he? 
Uh, I don't know. 
 How long ago was Ratatouille? 
Well, I'm gonna 
 go finish getting ready. 
Why don't you guys get 
 to know each other a little? 
So, uh, is there a dad that you
 spend weeks of your time with? 
My dad moved to Florida. 
Sounds right. What, um... 
 what grade are you in, bud? 
-Second. 
 -You don't say. 
Boy, I bet things are different
 than they were in my day. 
Lot of school shootings now. 
-What?! 
 -Oh, no. No, no, I... 
 No, I just meant... 
Like-like, people 
 bring guns to school? 
What? No, no, 
 I'm-I'm not saying... 
And they just shoot kids?! 
Well, you can hide 
 under your desk. 
The desks won't be enough! 
 (crying) 
All set. 
 You guys getting along? 
Yup, just great. All right, 
 let's go eat at a waffle house,
and then I'll show you 
 all my bow-hunting carcasses. 
That sounds like 
 a perfectly normal date. 
? ? 
Okay, I got a perfect way 
to distract Joe 
 while we take his car. 
There's literally 
 no phone survey he won't take. 
-(phone ringing) 
 -Hello? 
Yes, Joe Swanson? 
On a scale of one to ten, 
how happy are you 
 with your Wi-Fi service? 
Well, I'd say it's Wi-Fine. 
 (chuckles) 
I came up with that 
 ten months ago 
in anticipation 
 of this very call. 
Ha. Terrific. 
 And would you be willing 
to take a half-hour survey 
in your far upstairs bedroom 
 while facing the wall? 
Also, how loud does your TV get?
BONNIE: 
 Don't be long, Joe! 
 I'm expecting a call. 
I'll take the time I need! 
This is the Wi-Fi call. 
(engine starts) 
Great job 
 hot-wiring the car, Cleveland. 
The key was in the ashtray, 
but your presumption 
 will not be forgotten. 
(engine revving) 
(sighs) 
 You know, you're the Cub Scout.
We're supposed to be making this
Pinewood Derby car together. 
I don't care. 
Hey, you're one kid, 
 and we're four kids, 
-so we're gonna bully you. 
 -(grunts) 
Knock it off. 
Or what, 
 Kyle-Kyle-Dog-Poop-Pile? 
Hey, guys? 
 Let's take it easy 
and maybe not use canine feces 
 as a taunt. That's hurtful. 
What? 
 (chuckles) 
He's just saying 
 that Kyle's a little baby 
who's too stupid to even know 
 how to stand up for himself. 
What are you 
 gonna do, baby-- cry? 
-(growling) 
 -(screaming) 
Let go of me! 
 Stop! 
-You're crazy! 
 -You leave him alone! 
(barking) 
Whoa. 
 Thanks, Brian. 
Nobody's ever stood up for me 
 like that before. 
Well, I think my instincts 
 just kicked in. 
Want to help me sand your car? 
Yeah. 
 Definitely. 
Animal control? 
I'd like to schedule 
 an emergency neutering. 
? ? 
Man, I can't get over 
 how old-timey 
everything in this car is. 
I know. 
 Check out what's on the radio. 
NEWSWMAN: 
 President Kennedy has been 
 shot. 
NEWSMAN 2: 
 The martians are now 
 traveling to New Jersey. 
MAN: 
 ? Beatles song, Beatles song ? 
? La, la, la, la, la. ? 
Ah, that last one 
 brings back a lot of memories. 
Wow, this baby 
 handles like a dream. 
Do you guys mind 
 if I drive with my knees 
while I make some last-minute 
 fantasy football changes? 
-Look out! 
 -(tires screeching) 
-Oh, my God! 
 -Holy crap! 
Aw, man, 
 Joe is gonna be so pissed. 
Thank God all we hit 
 were those trash cans. 
Oh, my God. 
 Oscar! 
(grunts) 
 Tell my ex-wife... 
to go (bleep) herself. 
Very on-brand. 
Right up to the end. 
Thank you so much for having 
 Kyle and me over for dinner. 
Everything is delicious, 
 Mrs. Griffin. 
Well, I wasn't sure 
 what a divorc?e eats, 
so I just assumed fried things.
No, that's perfect. 
What about this guy? Did he help
with any of the cooking? 
Brian is not allowed 
 to touch communal food 
because his feet 
 smell like the street. 
I like when you measured my feet
at the store, 
Brian's girlfriend. 
Well, it... 
 it was my pleasure, Chris. 
I'm not actually sure 
 if my shoes fit right now. 
Um, could you do that thing 
where you push your thumb 
 on my big toe? 
Chris, you're within six years 
 of the same age 
as this kid you've never met 
and have nothing in common with.
Why don't you go up to your room
and have 
 an awkward time together. 
Um, okay. 
 Want to go upstairs 
and accidentally break 
one of my toys and I'll hit you?
I guess. 
CHRIS: 
 Hey, don't touch that! 
-(thud) 
 -(slap) 
Mom! 
 He blocked my punch and hit me!
I knew they'd get along. 
You know, Kyle and I actually 
 have to get going anyway, 
but thanks so much. 
Hey, Holly, before you go, 
settle an argument 
 between me and my wife. 
When measuring yourself, 
 what do you count as the base? 
-Peter. 
 -What? She measures stuff 
 for a living. 
Let me start 
 by saying I am taint inclusive.
All right, 
 I like where this is heading. 
Well, thanks again for coming. 
Oh, hey, you know, 
 I was thinking 
we could take Kyle 
 to Bos Funland on Saturday. 
Oh. Really? 
Yeah, I have to go there to buy 
Adderall anyway, so I thought...
Brian, stop. 
 I just... We can't go. 
-What? Why? 
-Honestly, I've been thinking...
STEWIE: 
 Uh-oh! 
Wh... W-What are you saying? 
Well, Brian, I'm still young. 
STEWIE: 
 Oh, she's saying you're not. 
And the truth is 
 I'd like to date other people. 
STEWIE (chuckles): 
 Oh, nail, meet coffin. 
In fact, my old boyfriend 
 is single again, 
and he happens to be 
 a very selfless lover. 
STEWIE: 
 Dude, I told you. 
But i-if we break up, 
does that mean 
I won't get to see Kyle, either?
I guess not. 
I'm sorry, Brian. 
? ? 
Touch my feet! 
-Touch my feet! 
 -Aah! 
(sighs) 
(sighs) 
-Oh. Hey, Stewie. 
 -Hey... you. 
-Feeling down? 
 -Yeah. 
Ah, don't worry about Holly. 
"There are other fish 
 in the sea" 
is what is usually said 
 at a time like this. 
-That's the thing. 
 It's not even Holly. 
 -Ugh. There's more? 
I mean, the person I actually 
 miss hanging out with is Kyle. 
We'd formed a real connection, 
and I sort of liked 
 being a father figure to him. 
That's... that's nice, Brian. 
Kyle and I 
 had actual fun together. 
I mean, most kids suck. 
They just want to sit around 
 and play Candy Land. 
-Yeah. Hell of a game. 
 -No, it's not. 
 Candy Land is terrible. 
There's not even any skill 
 to it. 
Uh, okay. 
 Um, you know what, Brian? 
You're hurt right now, 
and you're-you're saying things
 that you don't mean. 
But listen, 
 if you miss Kyle that much, 
-you should go find him. 
 -Thanks. Maybe I will. 
Just hope 
 he doesn't want to play 
some stupid game like Go Fish. 
Go Fish is a thinking man's game
of inquiry and consequence. 
 You know what? 
You know, I-I don't... I don't 
 have to explain myself to you. 
Go-go on. 
 Go find your kid. 
Damn it, what the hell 
 are we gonna do? 
-Joe's gonna be furious. 
 -Relax, Quagmire. 
From what I know 
 about car accidents, 
you can total your car, 
 completely walk away from it 
and still be Caitlyn Jenner. 
Besides, I'm pretty sure 
 I can pound this out. 
What the hell are you doing? 
-Crap, Joe's gonna kill us. 
 -Quagmire's right. 
Remember how upset he got 
 when they canceled Psych? 
(crying) 
Now who's gonna 
 expose charlatans 
by pretending to be psychic in 
 the greater Santa Barbara area?
Oh, my God. 
What? What is this? 
Is this Ferris Bueller? 
Yeah, it's Ferris Bueller. 
Hundred percent 
 on Ferris Bueller. 
Well, I'm glad 
 we got that settled. 
It's Fast Times 
 at Ridgemont High, you idiot! 
Joe, we all watched it 
 a week ago. 
Oh, yeah. You know, I enjoy 
 movies while I'm watching them,
but the second they're over, 
 I can't remember a thing. 
Except Forrest Gump. 
(imitating Forrest Gump): 
 "Try one of my candies. 
It'll tell you about life." 
(chuckles) 
 I can't forget that beauty. 
But what happened to my car?! 
We're really sorry, Joe. 
We took it without asking 
 and wrecked it. 
I like When Harry Met Sally... 
"I'll have the food 
 what made that lady came." 
You guys ruined my uncle's car.
We're so sorry, Joe. 
-It's okay. I'm not mad. 
 -You're not? 
No. 
 In fact, uh, 
all I feel is relief. 
Caring for a car like that 
requires round the clock effort.
Do you know how much 
 of a pain in the ass that is? 
BONNIE: 
 Yes! 
I mean, cars are meant 
 to be driven, 
not kept in a garage. 
But it's too late now. 
 I mean, look at it. 
I couldn't drive this car 
 even if I wanted to. 
I'm not so sure about that. 
? ? 
I'm doing it! I'm doing it! 
 This is awesome! 
I'm really d... 
 Oh, 
stop sign, Quagmire, stop sign!
(tires screech) 
Joe's legs are, um... 
 colder than I expected. 
No blood. 
(cheering) 
Brian, you made it! 
-Hey, buddy. 
 -What are you doing here? 
Holly, I was a terrible dad 
 with my own son, 
but I feel like I've made 
 a true connection with Kyle. 
Whoa, did you earn a ribbon? 
No, it's a bookmark 
 with a Bible verse on it. 
The priest was giving them out.
Oh. Weird. 
 Well, how'd our car do? 
Second to last. 
 But I don't care. 
I had so much fun 
 making it with you. 
Me too, Kyle. 
(whistle blows) 
Okay, thanks 
 for a great event, everyone, 
but we need to clear out. 
There's a sex offender meeting 
 in ten minutes, 
and we can't have any overlap. 
Thank you, Brian. 
 It was sweet of you to come. 
Aw. 
Say, Brian, what are you doing 
 Saturday night? 
Hi. I'm almost ready. 
Great. 
-How you doing, champ? 
 -(knocking) 
Okay, Cliff and I should 
 be back by midnight. 
I left money for you two 
 to order a pizza. 
Sounds perfect. 
All right, Kyle, 
 what do you say you and me 
watch some Stranger Things ? 
MORGAN FREEMAN: 
 Brian made Kyle 
 bread and butter, 
and kept the pizza money. 
Ich bin froh, 
 dass alles wieder normal ist. 
Tut mir leid wegen 
 deinem Auto, Joe. 
Es ist in Ordnung. 
Wo ist nun Jerome 
 mit den wiener? 
(giggles) 
 Wiener. 
Guten nacht, 
von das Disney Corporation.
