&#9834; It seems today that all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in movies and sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are those
good old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a man
who positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a... Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Chris, I can't believe
you're helping the principal
with morning announcements today.

And I can't believe
I forgot to wear pants.
- Meg, give him your pants.
- Mom!
Meg, it's a big day for your brother.
Fine.
It's so cool.
You're going to be like
one of those DJs on SiriusXM,
where it's all national
so nothing's local anymore.
You're listening to
SiriusXM channel
a-hundred-and-something.
Hey, it's hot out there, but
it's also cold in some places.
&#9834; SiriusXM a-hundred-and-something &#9834;
&#9834; You're probably in a rental car. &#9834;
These pants are way too big.
Okay, Chris, while you make
these announcements,
<script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"/><!-- subslikescript square adaptive --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6250492176235895" data-ad-slot="8838522786" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"/><script>     </script>
I'm going to be massaging
your shoulders,
just so I can say in court
that I do it to everyone.
And if you want to liven things
up, you can start out by saying,
"Good morning, Vietnam!"
- What?
- You know,
from the movie starring Robin Williams.
- Who?
- It was set in the Vietnam War.
- Where?
- He was nominated for an Oscar.
- Why?
- But, sadly, he recently died.
- How?
- He choked himself off.
That's the first thing I understood.
Go ahead.
Okay. "God..."
- Good.
- "Good movement..."
- Morning.
- "Morning, Engelbert."
- Everyone.
- "Everyone.
The stagnant cancer muting..."
The student council meeting.
You know what? You're done. Good job.
Great job, Chris.
Good morning, Vietnam!
Right?
Okay, well, the student council
meeting will be held today
at 3:00 in the gymnasium.
I never would've gotten that word.
Alexa, off.
And that's how you do an announcement.
Not like that tub of lard Griffin.
Ugh, I feel like I gained 20 pounds
just standing next to him.
I have to open the window
to get that fat kid smell out.
Hey, Lawnmower Guy?
How do you say "fat" in Spanish?
Gordo.
That kid was mucho gordo.
I think you mean "muy gordo."
That's enough, Lawnmower Guy.
Alexa, stop playing sad music.
I don't think this thing
is working at all.
- Hey, Stewie, where's the...
- Shh!
I'm at the opera, Brian.
This part always speaks to me.
I can't stand to hear Italians talk
but, man, get 'em singing.
Stewie, how can you afford
an entire opera in your room?
Oh, boy, Brian's upset
because someone has something
he doesn't.
You know what I'm getting you
for your birthday?
The ability to be happy
for other people.
You're not answering my question.
Brian, I'd love to stay and talk,
but Bugs Bunny is about to
make this tenor
hold a note for far longer
than anyone should.
Ain't he a stinker?
We now return to Suits.
As a courtesy to the
hardworking cast and crew,
we ask you to please refrain
from looking at your iPad
- while the show is on.
- Okay, fair enough.
Morning,
everyone. How's the case coming?
We're having trouble
supporting the defendant's claim.
Is this show a drama or a comedy?
I don't know, let's look it up.
Then you need to dig into those files...
- Eight seasons?!
- "Filmed in Toronto."
There's a Japanese version?!
"Other shows filmed in Toronto."
Handmaid's Tale, Shadowhunters...
- What's Shadowhunters?
- I don't know, let's look it up.
Guys, please,
people worked really hard on this.
Keith? Keith, what's the matter?
It's Chris, you idiot.
Mary, what happened?
Principal Shepherd fat-shamed Chris
in front of the whole school.
- Oh, no!
- Just stay the course, Lois.
That "fat" is going to win him
Biggest Boy at the state fair.
- Peter, this is very serious.
- So is Biggest Boy.
School should be a safe place
where they get shot sometimes.
They should not be insulted!
Peter, are you even listening to me?
Give us a strut downstage!
&#9834; Well, he's &#9834;
&#9834; A big, big boy, he's the Biggest Boy &#9834;
&#9834; He's a big, big boy,
he's the Biggest Boy &#9834;
&#9834; He's a big, big boy, he's the
Biggest Boy &#9834;
&#9834; He's a big, big boy,
he's the Biggest Boy... &#9834;
So we're all decided,
our last high school play
was about as gay as we wanna go.
Let's try to top out
at that level of gay.
If there's nothing else...
There's still the agenda item of
you fat-shaming Chris Griffin.
I think we can table that,
as long as it's a pretty strong table.
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
but fat-shaming is not okay!
This is the year 2020
and nothing is okay.
This is the year of instant outrage.
- What?!
- This is my son we're talking about.
Sure, more than once I've caught
him eating Crisco with a spoon,
but I can't watch everything he eats.
That's all I'd be doing!
And deep down, he's just like
everyone else...
all together in one big pair of pants.
His-his sister Meg's pants.
Oh! Pow!
Lois, did you try this stuff
out of town?
- It's killing!
- Yeah.
I'm funny.
In any case, Principal Shepherd
needs to be held accountable
for fat-shaming my son.
No matter how fat or shameful he may be.
If your son had been shot,
all I could offer
is thoughts and prayers, but this calls
for a far stronger response.
Shepherd, you're fired.
Oh, yeah? Well, now that I'm fired,
I can finally tell you all
how I really feel about you!
You're like family to me.
Alexa? Play the sad song from Stripes.
- Hey!
- We're still in here!
Uh, excuse me. I saw a commercial
in which a dog had a very shiny coat.
The dog was, uh, jumping over a fence.
Maybe on a farm or something?
Again, his coat was very shiny.
Yeah, I, um, hate this job?
So, I don't know?
Oh, my gosh, wow!
- This is so exciting!
- Excuse me?
It's really you.
We recognize you from your book!
Ah, you've read
Faster Than the Speed of Love.
Be careful with that thing.
It might accidentally change your life.
Oh, (BLEEP)!
I don't know that book.
I'm talking about this one.
Flunky The Dumb White Dog?
"By Griffin Stewart"?
My catchphrase is "Herf derf"?
Hey, do you know where I could
find any books about, um...
"the pan-crease"?
Thanks for taking me
to the movies, Peter.
Aw, sure, Lois.
You know, when you said "Miles Teller,"
I was like, "Eh."
But then once you get here,
you realize you can sit anywhere.
Hello, Griffins.
Principal Shepherd?
That's right.
And it's just "Firstname Shepherd"
now that you've had me fired
and I have no income.
And now I'm living in my car,
just panhandling outside
Miles Teller movies,
which is pretty slim pickings,
obviously.
Lois, can I talk to you
one step over this way,
yet magically out of earshot from him?
We can't let this stand.
We have to do something for him.
What are we supposed to do?
He brought this on himself.
All right, Peter, he can live with us
until he gets back on his feet.
You made a full and convincing case.
Ya...
...ay, you can live with us!
Wow, that's great news.
Uh, what's your, um, ferret policy?
Huh, wow, Lois,
if he's asking about it, too,
I guess we should finally get one.
Peter, we're not getting a ferret.
Also, would it make any sense
to put all the beds in one room
and make one room a trampoline room?
Oh, well, now that's interesting.
Well, here we are.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
I don't know how to thank you.
Ah, don't worry about it.
Make yourself at home.
The Wi-Fi is "Joe Swanson Guest."
Chris? There's someone here
who's got somethin' to say to you!
I've never seen this man before
in my life.
Principal Shepherd?!
What are you doing here?
Chris, I fat-shamed you,
and I believe I owe you
a weaselly political apology.
So, if you took offense
to anything I said,
I certainly regret that you did that.
At this point,
I consider the matter closed.
Thank you so much, Principal Shepherd.
I know that was very difficult for you.
Well, I accept your apology, Chris.
Onward and upward.
Now, I believe you have some
masturbating to do, young man?
I already did it.
- Chris...?
- I mean...
I was about to.
Attaboy.
Oh, he's a good boy.
Oh, he is.
This is real 'cause
I'm making the motor noise.
Hey there, Stewie.
Finally cutting that grass, I see.
Well, if someone had returned my mower
when they said they were going to,
I would've done it weeks ago.
Whoa, I see the mower isn't
the only thing running hot.
But speaking of, I, uh,
need to borrow a shovel.
- I'm digging a hole.
- A hole?
- Where are you going? China?
- That's the hope.
All right, well, I'll be
checking your Instagram.
Whoa, careful!
That's how God makes angels.
Well, I guess I know where you
got all that money!
You wrote a whole children's
book series about me.
And you made me look like a total idiot!
Look, you got to call the publisher
- and have these books recalled.
- Not a chance, Brian.
All I'm doing is presenting you
honestly to the public.
Just like I did to the witches in Salem.
Who but a witch would not
give up her virtue to a man
who brought her a luncheon
of salt pork and boiled sweets?
But Your Honor,
I tried to give up my virtue.
I begged him to take me then and there.
Yeah, okay, okay, n-nobody
believes that tall tale.
And he would have none of it.
I offered him posterior intimacy.
Okay, let's just...
E-everyone calm down.
The court reporter will still his quill.
On hands and knees I begged him.
He said he had an early appointment.
Witch! Witch! Press her between stones!
Attention, Griffins.
Could Peter Griffin please
report to the backyard?
Ooh...
Shut up.
Peter, I'm looking
at your aptitude assessment.
Uh, we think you would be
more comfortable
eating in the special breakfast unit.
It sounds like chaos in there.
Don't worry, Miss Judy
will take care of you.
She doesn't have her teaching degree,
but she is abnormally strong.
Why can't I just eat with my family?
We're trying to get you ready
to eat with your family.
Hey, you must be Miss Judy.
Ow, that's my wrist!
That's my wrist, Miss Judy! Ow!
Attention, Griffins.
Someone drew a penis on my car.
- Peter, I'm looking at you.
- Couldn't have been me.
I don't even know what penises
look like 'cause I'm not gay.
- Never even seen one.
- You don't have a penis?
I do, I just don't look at it
'cause I'm not gay.
Now, if it was a vagina,
I'd say you have your man.
Seen a ton of those.
Seen three of those.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, three? Deets, Dad.
- Okay, your mom...
- Nice.
- Your sister, when she was born...
- Getting colder.
And my aunt. She fell out
of the casket at her funeral
and her dress came up.
Did you know they pack cotton
in corpses' noses,
rectums and vaginas to prevent
embalming fluid from leaking?
Anyway, I gave the eulogy at the
church and I talked about it.
It was all ad-libbed.
Now that preacher won't even
make eye contact with me
at the grocery store.
I don't know why
that bothers me, but it does.
What were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, your car got donged.
Yeah, I did it. It was me.
Okay, who do I make this out to?
Actually, could you use a Sharpie?
No, my-my mom says I can't use Sharpies.
They're permanent.
Stewart Griffin?
I represent Brian Griffin,
who is suing you for defamation.
That's right, I lawyered up,
you little bitch.
Sorry I'm late, I was just...
Ah, ah, ah, en fran&#231;ais,
Monsieur Griffin.
God.
Je was watching Je Love Lucy, then je...
was wondering why Lucy
wasn't talking so much,
and then je realized it was just
a orange cat in a ashtray.
All right, never mind that.
Just join me one step over here,
yet out of earshot,
so I can rap your knuckles with a ruler.
Ah! That's it!
I want you out of our house right now!
- We are sick of you!
- What? You're kicking me out?
Does everyone feel this way?
- Oui, absolument.
- G&#233;rard Depardieu.
Well, at least someone's
been paying attention.
But very well.
I'll get out of your hair.
If you'll all just help me get
my things out of the basement.
Wait a minute. He doesn't have
his stuff down here.
That's right.
Until you all have better
attitudes, you're in detention.
Detention?
He-he put us in detention
in our own house?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Allahu Akbar!
We-we... uh, okay,
we're gonna deal with that thing
and then we're gonna deal
with detention.
How long is Principal Shepherd
gonna keep us in detention down here?
Oh, you got a big date? Is that it?
Got to get out of here for a big date?
- Is that what you're saying?
- Hey, bite my butt, Mom.
At least I'm not a withered
old slut like you are.
- Oh, just kiss and get it over with.
- Guys, guys, guys.
It's natural that we'd be at
each other's throats, all right?
We've been down here for three minutes.
The question is,
how are we gonna get out?
All right, we're playing.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Meg, Meg, Meg!
All right, who's next?
Mr. Griffin, you may proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
In my case to prove
that Brian Griffin is, in fact,
an idiot, and therefore
cannot be defamed, I call
Brian Griffin to the stand.
Now, Mr. Griffin,
you claim that you are not dumb.
If that is true,
please tell me the difference
between Michael Cera
and Jesse Eisenberg.
Objection.
No one could possibly know that.
Objection sustained.
- You're on thin ice, Counselor.
- Very well.
Now, Mr. Griffin,
I'm going to recite a biography
and I'd like you
to maintain your composure.
"On December 1, 1951,
- Treat Williams was born..."
- Treat? W-Where? Where?
- Where's the treat?
- Thank you.
I will now read the entry
for Christopher Walken.
Walk? Go for a walk?
This dog is dumb.
No further questions, Your Honor.
At this point, I will turn
things over to Brian's lawyer,
the gentleman from Table, Knee,
Bump and Associates.
Thank you, Your Ho... Ah! Son of a dick!
Ah! Ah, crap.
- Right on the bone. Ow!
- Do you wish to proceed?
Huh? No!
Sucks being in detention. I feel like
we're in The Breakfast Club
or something.
I don't know,
maybe we can take this time
- to learn more about each other.
- Sorry, Lois, we can't.
We got to Breakfast Club dance
for the Fox promo.
This Sunday, on an all-new Family Guy,
the Griffins are grounded
and the one actor of color
plays a character named Lawnmower Guy.
Way to go, everyone.
- Now we have this unearned closeness.
- Don't you see?
This must've been why Principal
Shepherd locked us down here.
We've never sat down
and talked like this.
Principal Shepherd
is the best principal ever.
I'm totally reenergized.
Like when my old high school crush
asked to be my friend on Facebook.
Karen Altman?
Wow, that's a blast from the past.
The game begins.
"Hey, cutie. Long time, no talk.
"I'm trapped in Europe
and all I have is my bikini.
Could you wire me $3,000
for old time's sake?"
Beatrice Fuller? She was a snack.
Checkmate.
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?
We have not, Your Honor.
We all feel we need another night
at the Hyatt with free HBO.
That free HBO was just
a preview. It ended today.
- We have a verdict, Your Honor.
- Please proceed.
The dog is an idiot. The baby wins.
Herf derf!
Well, congrats, Stewie.
You made me look like a fool up there.
I mean, I can't believe
you'd do this to me.
I'll never forgive you.
Who are you kidding, Brian?
You're a dog.
I'm gonna walk out that door,
come back in
and you'll just be excited to see me.
Hey! Hey! You're back!
Oh, man, I feel like
you've been gone forever!
Hey, watch me spin around!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Fat ankles.
All right, last call for new business.
And again, we cannot
show you the nude photos
the Spanish teacher sent to that kid.
Well, I guess that's it.
Let's get out of here.
- No, Peter, the other thing.
- Oh, right.
My name is Peter Griffin, and I
get to the "in conclusion" part
of my speech faster than most people.
In conclusion, I think the school
should rehire Principal Shepherd.
Mr. Griffin, you make
a brisk and compelling case.
I hereby reinstate Principal Shepherd.
Yes! I love you, baby.
Sorry, Lois, I needed you out of the way
so I could kiss this lady.
It's good to be back.
Wait, who drew this dong on my desk?
Not me. I wouldn't even
know how to draw one.
I've only seen two: mine
and my uncle's at his funeral.
He died with my aunt in a car crash.
Remember her, from earlier,
with the vagina?
My uncle didn't fall
out of the casket, though.
I stayed late
and unbuckled his trousers.
What were we talking about?
Oh, yeah, your desk got donged.
Yeah, I did it. It was me.
Well, Brian,
thanks for being a good sport
- about the Flunky books.
- No problemo, Stewie.
Aw, I wish you hadn't done that.
If anything, you gave me a good
chance for some self-reflection.
Fact is, you inspired me to get
back to doing some writing.
Wow, it's really you.
Oh, thanks, but I no longer
write the Flunky books.
No, not that book.
This one.
Swishy the Football Baby?
"By Griffin Brian"?
Can you say one of your catchphrases,
like, "Hey, sailor," or "Up for brunch?"
Ooh! How about "I'm a bottom"?
Brian!
- So?
- I'm sorry.
- It's not really our brand.
- I see.
Well, what about Phineas
and Ferb erotic fan fiction?
Now that is interesting.
Read it to me while I eat my soup.
"Ferb was having a throbby morning.
Phineas was having none of it."
Oh!
</div>\t'
