&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
ANNOUNCER: We now returnto Hard Knocks CFL:
Training Campwith the Toronto Argonauts.
I hope you make it.
You're real good.
No way, not asgood as you.
I hope you make it.
What're you gonna dowith all your money?
Oh, probablyjust save it.
Yeah, that'sreal smart.
Well, backto my book.
Peter, I was at the parkwith Stewie,
and someone stolehis tricycle.
And during, like,the one second
I was looking down at my phoneand not at him.
Stupid thief.
It's got a vanity platethat won't even apply to him.
Hey.
You like your reggaewatered down
and acceptableat a wedding?
Hop on.
Ugh, can't believe somebodystole Stewie's trike.
I only had nine paymentsleft on that thing.
How much do you make?
Don't worry, Lois, I'mgonna find that tricycle.
I'll just have four to fivebeers to stop the shaking,
and then I'llgo outside.
Huh, never seen that kidaround the neighborhood.
Maybe he's got somethingto do with it.
Hey, kid.
You know anythingabout a tricycle
that just got stolenfrom the park?
No, sir, I've beensitting here
for the last three hoursselling lemonade.
Would you likean ice-cold glass?
Why, sure.
You couldn't have been herefor three hours on this,
the hottest dayof the year,
or the ice cubes in yourpitcher would have melted.
Ow...
You have the rightto remain silent.
Anything you say...
Peter, Peter! Wecan't arrest him.
If anything, theycan arrest you.
Hey, here'sthe tricycle.
You were right,Peter.
This kid's a thief.
We did it!
Wow, look at us.
Hey, you know,we make a great team, guys.
Like Huey Lewisand the Jews.
&#9834; We don'tneed money... &#9834;
Sorry, the band'sbreaking up.
Here you go, Stewie.
Don't bother sniffingthe seat.
It don't smelllike nothing.
Oh, yeah, my trike.
Eh, I'm kind ofover that thing.
Now I'm way into woodenbeads you move along wires.
Whoa...
Oh, yeah...
Boy, when you finda baby's tricycle,
it feels like there'snothing you can't do.
Man, I wish wecould quit our jobs
and solve children'scrimes full-time.
I heard you guys aregood at solving cases.
I'll give you 50 cents tofind my lucky baseball card.
Guys, we'rein business.
(celebrating)
Oh, wait a minute, I didn'tnotice you have a pierced ear.
We can't help you.
You go homeand tell your mother
she's supposed to bea parent, not a friend.
All right, guys, this'll bethe headquarters
for our newdetective agency.
This milk cratewill be my chair,
this overturned rain barrelwill be my desk,
and this DNA evidencecentrifuge
and fingerprint scannerwill be my coatrack.
Piece of junk.
I guess all our detectiveagency needs now is a name.
Well, we're detectivessolving children's crimes.
There's only one namethat makes sense.
"Dicks for Kids"?"Dicks for Kids."
But wait, we want peopleto know we're grown-ups.
Okay, "Big DicksFor Kids."
But we don't wantto sound too old.
They're gonna think we're abunch of old, bald geezers.
"Big Hairy Dicksfor Kids."
How are we gonna let themknow we're "veiny"?
So, you say this gumball machinetook your dime
and didn't give youa gumball?
That's right.
Well, I'll take careof that.
Hand over the dime, buddy.
Come on, hand it over.
Don't make thishard on yourself.
Wait a minute.
This gumball machinetakes quarters, not dimes.
(siren wails)
Holy crap, it's a setup.
Time to make a quick getaway.
You were set up,too, huh?
Yeah.
You realize that kid is plowingboth our wives right now.
So what do we gottoday, boys?
Well, it seems like we gota bit of a crime spree.
Just this morning,we've had multiple reports
of stolen items.
Uh, couple marbles, ballof yarn, two Wiffle ball bats.
Someday a rain'll come and washall this scum off the streets.
Guys, I think I got alead on all these thefts.
One of the kids hada nanny-cam hidden in his room.
Come on, let's do iton your son's tiny bed.
Hurry, he gets homeat 3:00.
Okay, it's later than this.
Y-Yeah,f-fast-forward ahead.
Forward. Forward.
Keep forwarding.
Is that womangonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.
We're having brunchafter this.
God, I look hugein that bed, don't I?
You think otherguys hang out
and watch their friend'snaked gyrating butt?
It's been so long, I don'tknow what other friends do.
Forwarding, forwarding,forwarding...
And there we go.
Our thief.
(gasps)
Chris Gaines was Garth Brooks.
I just figured that out.
Oh, my God, Chris stoleall that stuff.
No way,he wouldn't do that.
Peter, Chris ison the tape.
We got to searchhis bedroom.
Fine, go ahead.
But I'm telling you, it's gonnabe a bigger waste of time
than writing tough-guy dialoguefor a Jet Li movie.
(grunting)
(grunting, bone cracking)
This is yourlast warning.
Give me back my wife.
What? Excuse me?
Give me back my wife, oryou're in a lot of trouble.
I'll kick allyour faces.
You got me?
You're kind of undoingeverything you just did
when you kickedmy ass.
I know, but I haveto say for audience.
Chris still hasan Aaron Hernandez poster up?
That's not cool.
See, there's nothing here.
Just a weird life-sizedlady doll
made out of all the stuffthat got stolen.
CHRIS:No!
Don't hurt Heather.
Don't hurt my girlfriend.
What the hell?!
Chris madea sex doll?!
Your kid's gota walk-in closet?
Two of mine gotta sleepin the car.
Chris is stillin his room
with that disgustinghomemade sex doll.
He actually thinksit's his girlfriend.
I know, it's weird.
It's even weirder than thatsecret level in Donkey Kong.
&#9834; &#9834;
Maybe it's our fault Chrishas such a screwed-up idea
about whata relationship is.
I mean,let's be honest,
we're not exactly the modelof a healthy marriage.
Oh, boy, is this 'cause ofthe time I pushed off of you
after sex andbruised your boob?
No, I-I mean, when was thelast time you bought me flowers,
or-or we hada date night?
We do stuff.
Just last week, I letyou watch me complain
after eating toomany hot wings.
Ugh!
Why did you let medo this, Lois?!
Why?!
Okay, Peter, I got to takethe kids to school now.
Hey, Chris,
your mother wanted meto talk to you.
Um, she doesn't thinkit's healthy for you
to be spending all your timewith a homemade sex doll.
Sex doll?
I wish.
Heather hasn't even letme get to second base.
Wh... H-Hang on.
What's second base?
Is that touchingone of the cabbages?
Yeah.
(groans) But I'm such a loser,she'll never let me do that.
Come on, Chris,don't sell yourself short.
You are every bit as goodas that bag of garbage.
You really think so?
Sure, I do.
And look, if you really wantto learn how to bang that thing,
there's no better teacherthan your old dad.
After all, I'm the guywho taught old Asian people
how to geton the subway.
(scream approaching)
Out of the way!
Nobody else matters!
All right,you made it.
Now twirl that long hairsticking out of your face mole.
And cough-- cough likeyou never coughed before.
(coughing violently)
Okay, Chris, now, women reallydig those firemen calendars.
So we're gonna go insideand get some sexy shots
of you doingfireman stuff.
&#9834; Well, I'm hot blooded &#9834;
&#9834; Check it and see &#9834;
&#9834; I got a fever of 103 &#9834;
&#9834; Come on, baby &#9834;
&#9834; Do you do more than dance? &#9834;
&#9834; I'm hot blooded,I'm hot blooded &#9834;
&#9834; You don't haveto read my mind... &#9834;
(sighs)Look, Heather.
The truth is, I don't careif we never take it
to the next level,physically.
I just really likespending time with you.
(chuckles)Wow.
I'm gonna have to writeto somebody about this.
"Dear Penthouse,
"I used to thinkthese letters were fake
"until my taped-together,soccer-ball-headed girlfriend
fell in my lap."
Hey, do we still havea magazine?
Good morning, everybody.
I think Heather will beeating breakfast
standing up this morning,if you know what I mean.
Peter, I thought you weregonna take care of this.
You were supposed to makeChris get rid of that doll.
I did take care of it.
He slept with it,and now he'll slowly
grow to hate itover the next 20 years.
This is all your fault.
You never listento anything I say.
Look, you told meto talk to him.
I talked to him.
And now you'renagging me about it?
God, you're more annoying thana creative voice mail message.
JOE: &#9834; Joe is on a vacationfar away &#9834;
&#9834; You called him upto talk it over &#9834;
&#9834; So many thingsthat you want to say &#9834;
&#9834; Leave your messagewhen the beep is over &#9834;
&#9834; I don't wantto miss your call &#9834;
&#9834; Tonight &#9834;
&#9834; I already missedyour call tonight. &#9834;
(beeps)
I... I can't remember
who I called.
Oh, Lois, thank God!
Listen, I can't decide whatI want for breakfast tomorrow.
Can you make me a sample tray?
You know what, Peter?
I'm not talkingto you right now.
You screwed upbad with Chris.
And you stillhaven't apologized
for the way youtreated me earlier.
Aw, come on, Lois.I'll make it up to you.
Maybe sooner than you know.
(doorbell rings)
Oh, Peter!
They're beautiful!
You're such a sweetheart.
Read the card.
"To Heather, from Chris"?
Oh, I thought it mighthave a funny riddle on it.
Oh, good, the flowers came!
We're just cocooning todaybecause Heather said
she's never seen TV.
So, we're starting withseason six of Becker.
I'm just gonna beeasing her in.
Lois, before you say anything.
I also got you a gift.
It's a Katherine Heigl mask foryou to wear while we have sex.
She's perfect, becauseshe's only sort of hot,
so there won't be this crazydisconnect of her face
on your body, which wouldtotally take me out of it.
Also, it's designed so youcan wear it on your butt.
Heather, I madeyour favorite cookies.
And now I want to hearall about your day.
Hey, Lois, I heard KatherineHeigl likes to French kiss.
Oh, my God!
Chris treats that pile of junkbetter than Peter treats me!
What's the matter, Lois?Need to get in the mood?
How about a littlehelp from Kenny G?
&#9834; &#9834;
I wonder if Cleveland'sgonna want his sax back.
Oh, hi, Chris.
Where have you been?
Heather and I wentfor a tandem bike ride.
And then had lunchat a gastropube.
Nope.
Huh. Sounds like fun.
What have you guys been up to?
Your father got a DVD of blackpeople fighting in the street.
It's not justin the street.
Some of them are inprivate residences.
Oh. Well, tomorrow, Heatherand I are going to the park
to picnic and fly kites.
And on Saturday,she's hosting her book club,
so I have to drop by,say something funny,
and then stay upstairs.
Wow, your plans soundvery sweet and romantic, Chris.
And how a manshould treat his woman.
Oh, Lois, your breathsmells like eggs.
Talk that way.
Chris, when you go on yourpicnic tomorrow,
c-can your fatherand I come with you?
Let me just ask Heather.
I know, but I think we better.
Apparently the cancer'salready in his bones.
What?We'd love to, sounds great!
What are you doing?You can't let him
keep thinkingthat doll is real.
I know. But I justwant Peter to see
what a thoughtful man lookslike for one afternoon.
Maybe he'll learn something.
Are you sure about this?
It seems pretty extreme.
Well, I got to try something.
Peter and I usedto be so close.
But now we're likeapples and oranges.
People say we're different, butwe're really not that different.
Mm-hmm, yeah, weboth work in marketing.
We've both lost children.
We both own cars, butwe like to take the bus.
And we both cheatat Words With Friends.
Oh, nice try!
I certainly do not!
And we're both gonnahave a moderate time
at the party tonight.
And we're not gonna counteach other's drinks.
We won't have tobecause we won't be drinking.
Wow, it sure is fun goingon a picnic, isn't it, Peter?
Yeah. Will you holdthis beer bottle
while I try to kickthe top off it?
Ow! Damn it!
You moved it.
&#9834; Raindrops are fallingon my head &#9834;
&#9834; And just likethe guy whose feet &#9834;
&#9834; Are too big for his bed &#9834;
&#9834; Nothing seems to fit &#9834;
&#9834; Those raindrops are fallingon my head &#9834;
&#9834; They keep falling &#9834;
&#9834; Because I'm free &#9834;
&#9834; Nothing's worrying &#9834;
&#9834; Me. &#9834;
Close your eyes, Heather.
I've got a surprise for you.
None of your businesshow much it was.
He bought her a scarf.
And it actually goes wellwith her colors.
Peter, don't you seewhat's going on here?!
Your son's relationshipwith that doll
is better than our own marriage!
Peter?
Hey, can me and Ramongo ride shirtless bikes?
(sighs)
(hinges creaking)
(screams)
My morning scream.
(sighs)
(screams)
Heather's gone!
Mom! Heather's disappeared!
Have you seen her?!
No, I haven't, sweetheart.
B-But you know what?
Sometimes relationshipsrun their course
and come to a natural end.
This could be a signthat it's time to move on.
Aw, and I just helped himpick out that scarf.
I miss her so much.
I know, honey.
But if you give ita little time,
I'm sure you'll get over her.
Just like you got over yourHamster Dance Tourette Syndrome.
Excuse me, Mom,could you please pass the...
&#9834; Dee dah dee dahdee deh doh doh &#9834;
&#9834; Dee dah dee dah doh &#9834;
&#9834; Doo doo doo doo doodleloodle doo dah doo &#9834;
&#9834; Doo dah doodle doodah doodle doh doh. &#9834;
His brain ain't right,but it's fun.
(crying)
Hey, Chris.
I-I see you're sad.
And also sittingon the remote.
Why did Heather leave me?!
I don't know, but sometimeswhen life's got you down,
you-you got to standup for a second.
Like-like, just for a second.
I've never felt this sad!
Aw, looks like somebodycould use a hug.
(crying)
Here we go.
Oh, no, I hit input!
Oh, no! Oh, God!
We may have to throwaway the television.
What should I do, Dad?
I don't know. Hey, where'sthat girlfriend of yours?
She seems cool.
(crying)
(crying)
This day has Haagen-Dazswritten all over it.
(crying)
Boy, he's really upset.
(groans) I can'tdeal with anything
until I've had myafter-nap coffee.
(slurping)
I don't think guys should havetwo hands on a coffee mug ever.
What?
Mmm, oh, yummy.
Don't do that, either.
J-Just-just don't do anything.
(sighs)
Hey, Chris.
I see you turned your hat aroundso you can really get in there.
Oh, what do you care?
What does anybody care?
Why don't you come with me?
I-I've got somethingto show you.
If it's the shot from Psychowhere you can see
Anne Heche's bunghole,I've already seen it.
No, Chris, it'ssomething else.
Come on.
Heather? Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, Chris.
You-you did this?
I did.
I took your dollbecause it's not a natural
or healthy thing for a boyyour age to have.
It looks likeyou stabbed her.
Like, 50 times.
I was kind of jealous of it, soI guess I went a little crazy.
Also, her lipstickis all smeared.
I was having a lotof strange feelings!
Look, Chris, I'm sorry.You can have Heather back.
But I just want you to know,if you ever treat a real woman
the way you treat that doll,
you're gonna make hervery happy.
Really?
Absolutely.
And I know she'll make youvery happy, too.
You know... I don't think
I need Heather anymore.
You don't?No.
I'm glad to hearthat, Chris.
Seems like maybeyou're growing up.
Maybe.
I guess there's justone thing left to do.
What's that?
Give me that knife.
I got to cut out the baby.
Oh, my God!
It's made of Skittles.
You want to eat the babytogether on the way home?
Yeah, I'd like that, Chris.
You know, Lois, I've beenthinking about what you said.
And I did learna little something
from watchingChris and Heather.
You did?Yeah.
From now on, I am gonna be
treating you like garbage.
Oh, Peter. Thank you.
I love you, Lois.
CHRIS:Mom? Dad?
I want you to meetmy new girlfriend!
This is Mistress Vita.
We met on Craigslist.
No talking unless I say!
Hi, Peter.
How'd she know your name?
Peter, are-are you justtrying to take a knee
until the end of the show?
Peter, that's not gonna work.You can't just... </div>\t'
