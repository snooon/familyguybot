&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;

You can't do a bull runwith a guy in a wheelchair.
Yeah, this is for athletes.
Just the regular wash, please.
And, uh, I'm supposed to mentionthat I saw you on LivingSocial?
Was that worth it?
Was that worth theone dollar you saved?
I'm sorry, we're not doingthat promotion anymore.
Oh-ho!
All the humiliation,none of the reward.
You know, some people are okaywith the drive-through car wash.
Me, I'm a fan of the hand job.
Hi, I'm Brian.
Yes, I like to have funwith language.
(laughs)You're so funny.
I'm Tori.
I got hit by a carin high school,
so I don't have to work.
Cool. Hey, so what'syour afternoon like?
I don't have plans.
Maybe we could grab lunchand then see what happens.
(groans)This will not end well.
Like eating an artichoke.
Good Lord!
I ate nothing and I'msoaking wet for some reason.
So, you guys all pumpedto run with the bulls?
You bet, this is gonna bemy first exercise
since I chased that balloon.
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, Joe.
We are competing...
in the international ChefBoyardee look-alike contest.
Oh, well,where's your chef hat?
You guys are gonna lose.
Especially Cleveland.
He's in the Cream of Wheatcompetition,
which is down the street.
We-we got to go now.We're very late.
Well, this is funny, because...
guess where I'm going.
And I got the hat.
You guys are dead!
(sighs)Look, Joe.
We didn't want to tellyou, but we're going
to the SeriouslyWicked Bull Run.
We didn't invite you because wedidn't think you could keep up.
Yeah, we thought it seemedtoo dangerous for, uh,
incapacitated, half-man,shrivel-legged gimps.
And we didn't wantto hurt your feelings.
Come on, my handicaphas never held me back.
I'm coming with you guys.
Joe, you peed in your bagwhile you said that.
Can you honestly saythat you didn't pee
just now while youwere talking?
Okay, you can come.
Wow, that was amazing.
Hey, uh, uh,just to be clear,
I don't reallythink you're a whore.
I-I just need to say thatto, you know, to finish.
Oh, yeah, yeah,yeah, of course.
And obviously, I don't thinkyou're my Uncle Dale.
Good, good, same page.
(car engine humming outside)
Oh, crap,my husband's home early.
Wait a minute,you're married?!
And he's here?Now?!
(car door closes)
Yeah, that's him.
You've got to get out of here.
He's really jealous.
I think he's bitterbecause he never got
the credit he deservedfor killing Osama bin Laden.
Your husband's a Navy SEAL?!
What the hellis going on here?!
What is this?
Ruff!
You got a dog?
Uh... yeah!
I rescued himfrom the pound.
(barking)
Well, hey there, buddy.
Wow, his nose is super wet!
He must be healthy.
Uh, and somebody's beenrooting in a sardine can.
Well, I'm gonnagrab a shower.
Great, honey.
Oh. Oh, my God,that was close.
Yeah, but think about it.
As long as he thinksyou're our new pet,
we can keep foolingaround behind his back.
Huh, you're right.
Wow, this could bean even better scam
than that claw machineat the arcade.
Damn it, this game is so stupid!
It's impossible to do anythingwith a dumb, crappy claw!
Hey, that's mean,and it's not even true!
I'm leaving!
Dang it!
You need a little help?
No!
If you could angle up the ring,then I could kind of hook it.
How do you drive?
Bad!
(crowd clamoring)
(snorting, bellows)
We clearly overdressed.
They have the typeof fat white woman here
that not evenI am interested in.
ANNOUNCER:Ladies, gentlemen,

Aah! I shouldn'thave worn high heels!
Oh, stop it!You look great.
Oh, well, I didn't wantall this attention.
CLEVELAND:Cleveland, why do you let them
talk you into these things?
This is howpeople pleasers die!
Hey, guys, after this,let's beat alligators
with sticks or something.
You read my mind!
We just talked about this!
(whoops)This is amazing!
I told you guys I could do it!
Look... out...
Joe...!
(wheels screeching)
(distorted screaming)
(grunting)
(screaming)
Joe, oh, my God!
You all right?!
I can't feel anythingbelow my neck!
I can't move a muscle, guys!
Oh, my God!
Joe's completelyparalyzed!
("Walk Like a Man"by the Four Seasons playing)
Oop, that's me.
That's unfortunate.
That's Lois, hold on.
Hey, babe.
Uh, good.
Little hiccup, but fun.
You guys!
I've been trying to keepmy birthday a secret.
No, Dr. Hartman, we're nothere for your birthday.
We're here for Joe.
Don't sugarcoat it, Doc.
Just give it to me straight.
Well, Mr. Swanson, I didan exploratory procedure,
which revealed extensive damage.
Please, just tell me--am I completely paralyzed?
I'm afraid...
of ghosts.
And yes.
Mr. Swanson haslost all movement,
and will requirearound-the-clock care.
Most of it disgusting.
Oh, my God, Bonnie,I'm so sorry.
If there's anythingI can do...
There actually is.
Could you collectmy mail forever?
I'm leaving Joeand moving to Europe.
I didn't sign up for this.
Bonnie, wait!God, this is awful.
What am I gonna do?
Well, seems like you folkshave this all taken care of.
(door opens)
PEOPLE:Surprise!
HARTMAN:Oh, you guys!
Hey, don't go inthat room back there.
It's, like,super sad.
Coming up, quintupletsborn at Quahog General.
What?That's...
Oh, that's supposedto be "burn"?
Oh, coming up, quintupletsburn at Quahog General.
Hey, honey, get in here.
Check this out--the way he's sitting,
it looks like the dog'swatching the news.
You like watching thenews, you dumb dog?
Well, I'm off to do whatformer Navy SEALs do--
sell lawn mowers.
Wow, he reallyhas no idea.
Hey, want to takea shower with me?
Sure.
Man, this is a pretty sweet gig.
Like being a memberof Daft Punk.
(French accent):Look at this old Casio keyboard
from the 1980sthat I have found.
Watch what happenswhen I push this demo button.
&#9834; &#9834;
Hello, Daft Punk?
Great song.Here's a Grammy.
Oh-ho-ho!
(French accent):You know, is funny.
Until you spoke, I didnot know we were French!
There you go, Joe.All settled.
Now, which wallwould you like to look at
for the rest of your life?
I don't know,maybe that one.
I-I have no ideawhat you're pointing at, Joe.
You got to meet us halfway.
Look, guys, I don't wantto be a burden to anyone.
You go aheadand live your lives.
I'll be fine.
We can't justleave you, Joe.
So before we go, I'm gonnaput the remote in your mouth.
Here's a can of chili.
And the opener we'll put...in your mouth.
And here's a magazine I thoughtyou might like to read.
I'm gonna put itin your mouth.
(grunts)
(muffled):You're a good friend, Peter.
Joe, I just wishwe could do more,
but obviously yourmouth is full.
And you probably don't wantany reminders of Bonnie
around the house, so I clearedout all of her underwear.
Okay, don't be a stranger.
Yeah, 'cause we're notsupposed to talk to those.
I don't know, I'm not sureI feel right about leaving Joe.
Doesn't seem like he's gonna beable to take care of himself.
Yeah, we're-we're kindof all he has now.
What-- Joe?
What're you talking about?
He's fine.
Look, he's already watchingThe Price Is Right in there.
Oop, he's bitingtoo hard on the volume.
(The Price Is Righttheme song playing)
Okay, you can play over therein the sandbox, honey.
Mommy's just gonnaread her book.
Okay, I'm just gonnawalk 30 feet away,
and then panicbecause I can't see you.
Can you fit me inat 10:00 tomorrow?
It's getting a littlelong on the sides.
Brian? What are youdoing on a leash?
And who's that?
(shushes)Be cool.
This is the guy whosewife I'm banging.
Oh, what a romantic wayto put it.
Yeah, it's great.
I just pretendto be their dog,
and then when he leavesfor work,
I get to go to the pound,if you know what I mean.
God, Brian,you are such a scumbag.
I can't believe you--
Mommy! Mommy!Where's my mommy?!
I have no one and nothing!
LOIS:I'm right here, honey.
Oh, thank God.
She's such a gross hog.
Joe, you can'tjust sit here.
You need intellectualstimulation.
So I brought somethingto read to you.
It's the word searchfrom the Sunday Circular.
"Kangaroo."
Let's see if wecan find that one.
"Outback."
I think it's anAustralian theme.
"Koala."
It definitely is.
Can't make out this one.
"Abor... Aborgine...
Aborgina"?
That's what they calleggplant down there.
You know what?Forget this.
I'll just readto you from Jet.
Look, this whole page isall the Wayans brothers
sitting in differentpositions.
How you suppose they come upwith all them positions?
You could give mea million years.
I just ain'twired that way.
Marlon's likea rubber man.
He can sit inany kind of way.
Here's Keenan telling theyounger ones how to sit.
(scoffs) Like theygonna listen.
Damon's doinghis own thing.
No surprise there.
That's Damon.
You enjoyingall this, Joe?
I'm honestlyjust glad it seems
like you havesomething you like.
Hey, my laptop'sout of battery.
You want to have sex?
Sure, I've almost finishedmy sandwich, anyway.
Oh, come on, I don't wantto have to watch this.
VIC:Yeah, that's right.
I was the only onewho didn't get to meet Biden.
(groans)You know what?
Screw this.I'm out of here.
Ha! Skewered.
VIC:Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
You're my dog.
You're not going anywhere.
Besides, I need you, boy.
Now more than ever.
I think my wifeis cheating on me.
Hey, Tori, it's Brian.
I'm gettingthe Chinese food for us.
I think I'm gonna ordersome Me Like Bang Ho.
(laughs)That's-that's not a real thing,
I'm talking about sex.
All right,I'll be there in five.
Man, when I findthat son of a bitch,
I'm gonna riphis head off.
God, what a nightmare.
That guy's even scarierthan a thesaurus-asaurus.
Tread, stomp, trudge.
Growl, roar, ululate.
Antonym-- whisper.
What's wrong with him?
He's on the spectrum.
"Spectrum"?
In my day we'dthrow him in the army
and have himplay the bugle.
Peter, this just isn't working.
We can't takeproper care of Joe.
It's a huge amount of work
and we don't haveany idea what we're doing.
Quagmire's right.
It's too much.
I just think he'dbe better off
under the care of grumpy,Filipino nurses.
Yeah, that's whyI looked into it,
and we've reserveda place for him
at the State Home forMentals and Bastards.
Oh, my God, sometimesthey whip them with hoses...
outside?!This is perfect!
Hi, I work here.
I don't thinkthis guy works here.
Hi, can I help you?
Yeah, this is Joe Swanson.
We arranged for a 9:15 dump-off?
Go on, guys, get out of here.
I'll be fine.
Bye, Joe.
Take care, man.
See ya, Joe.
Hold on, guys.
There's one last thingI got to say to my friend.
Hey, Joe, you knowthat movie you told me to watch
that you said wasyour favorite movie of all time,
and you saidI had to watch it?
Backdraft-- youfinally watched it?
Yeah.Wasn't it great?
I thought it was stupid.
Take care, Joe.
You know, tha-that state home weleft Joe in didn't seem so bad.
Yeah, it's gotto be good.
I mean, Napoleon Bonapartewas there.
Would the French peoplelet their boss walk around
in stained underwear,trying to stab people
if the place wasn't nice?
Yeah, no, no,y-you're right, you're right.
Joe will getmuch better care there.
I still feel bad.
Come on, you guys.Joe's gonna be fine.
He'll fit in great there.
Not likewhen I went to Hogwarts.
Slytherin.
Hufflepuff.
Housing for registeredsex offenders!
Aw.
Oh, Tori, thank God.
Listen, you gotto unchain me.
Look what Vic did.
Tell me about it.
He's lost his mind.
That's why I'm gonna go staywith my mother in Baltimore
and work at her wife's bar.
Wait, what?!
Tori, come back!
Damn it!
Wow, shocker.
Your gross hookupfrom the car wash ended poorly?
Stewie, thank God!
How'd you find me?
Well, you rememberwhen the vet knocked you out
to take out that rotten tooth?
He also put a tracking chipin your neck.
What?! That's a totalviolation of my rights!
Heh, I like how you'rechained up in a yard
and still tryingto pretend you're a guy.
Look, you got to help me.
Her husband's a maniac and theonly reason he hasn't killed me
is because he thinksI'm just his pet dog.
Hmm, he's gota padlock on here.
But don't worry,I'll figure something out.
Well, hurry, 'cause I'm trappedlike a baseball announcer.
ANNOUNCER:And the count is two and two.
Garcia stepsoff the mound again,
virtually guaranteeingthat my wife
will be asleep when I get home.
The big right-hander kicksa little dirt and tosses
the rosin bag as my childrengrow up without me.
Okay, and now a fan in thestands is giving me the finger.
I agree.
Hey, I don't knowif you can hear it,
but I'm peeingin my coffee cup right now.
There you are.
Where the hell have you been?
I got arrested for huckin'a TV/VCR combo off the dam.
Off the damn what?
Off the damn overpass.
(laughs):Oh...
God, I love you, Lois.
That was like great sex.
But seriously,it-it was bad.
It hit a school bus.
Oh, my God!
Well-well, can yougo talk to Joe?
Maybe he can put in a word foryou down at the police station.
Yeah, yeah, Joe, yeah, may--yeah, maybe, maybe.
Do you, uh, you-youwant a back rub?
Peter, what's going on?
Uh, what do you mean?
Whenever you offerme a back rub,
it means you'rehiding something.
(gunfire)
(chickens clucking)
You, hey, you-youwant a back rub?
We may or may nothave put Joe
in a smelly homefor the goofy.
What?! Peter, those placesare a horror show!
Joe's your friend!
How could you treathim like that?
We just couldn't handle himbeing fully paralyzed.
We didn't know what else to do.
But you're right.
We got to get him out of there.
You most certainly do.
All right, how aboutthat back rub now?
What are you, nuts?
What the hell do you want?
Oh, hello, sir.
I'm afraid there'sbeen a mistake.
I believe you found our dog,and we need to take him home.
No way!Get lost, kid.
He's my dog now.
Well, we figuredyou'd say no to us,
but not to Vice PresidentJoe Biden!
Oh, my God!
Mr. Vice President!
First, I wantto thank you, Vic,
for shooting the guywe said was Osama bin Laden.
Second, give these kidstheir dog back.
Of course, sir,I'm so sorry!
Here, take him!
Thank you.
You're a great American.
Thanks, Mr. Biden!
No problem.
Hey, you guys watch Veep?
No.
Yeah, it's all fake.
Yeah, we said no.
Hi, uh, we're hereto pick up Joe Swanson.
Are you from the news?
You have to tell usif you're from the news.
No, we're his friends.
What are you guysdoing here?
We came to bringyou home, Joe.
We're all really sorrywe abandoned you.
Yeah, we just kind of gotoverwhelmed and all freaked out.
But we're yourfriends, Joe.
And we'll always be therefor you no matter what.
Thanks, guys.
I'd say let's get my stuff,but it's all been stolen.
That's okay.
Come on, let's go home.
Sorry, no onegets out of here
without a releasefrom their doctor.
All right, we'll justcall him right now.
(phone ringing)
What's that ringing?
Joe, that ringing--it's coming from your back!
It is?
Holy crap!
Dr. Hartman must havedropped his phone in Joe
when he was lookingat his spine!
Oh, thank God.
I've been hearingthat ringing all week.
I just thoughtI was losing my mind
from lunaticsscreaming in my face.
Your mother's a whore!
I told you thatin confidence, Gary.
Ah, it's so greatto have you back, Joe.
You seem good as new.
Yeah, it turns out Dr.Hartman's cell phone
was pressing onmy spinal cord,
and that's what was causingmy total paralysis.
Yeah, sorry we droppedthe ball for a while,
which is the way we agreed we'ddescribe what we did to you,
which hopefullymakes it seem less heinous.
It's all right, guys.
I'm just glad to beback on my feet.
Well, you knowwhat I mean.
(laughter)
PETER:I never saw muchof Joe after that.
And while he's been gonefor many years,
I've never forgotten his face
or his laughter.
Come on, are wegoing to the beach?
We've been waiting forever.
Yeah, be right there,champ.
He said that the firsttwo times we asked.
I know, he spaces outwhen he's at the computer.
These aren't my kids.
And also, this isn'tplay wrestling.
We're actually fighting. </div>\t'
