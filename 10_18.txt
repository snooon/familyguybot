It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex an TV
But where are those
good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do
All the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He's a family guy
Need to move?
No problem.
Take it yourself with U-Haul.

But I've never driven a truck before.
No problem.
U-Haul lets anyone drive a giant truck
even though it's dangerous,
Because, hey, you're moving.
Sorry, I'm making a go ofit in a new city.
All right, I'll see you guys
in a couple of days.
Where are you going?
I'm off to take pictures of lesbian butts.
- What?
- Joe and Quagmire and I
are making a coffee table book
called Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.
I already got the first chapter right here.
Where'd you take all these pictures?
You know, coffee houses, Chevy
dealerships, all the usual places.
Peter, you're not doing that.

I got a ton of errands to run,
and I need your help around here.
Well, fine, if I can't do the book,
I'm gonna hurt something you love.
You happy now?
Maybe we should discuss this
in the other room.
I don't like fighting in front of the kids.
No, I want to fight in front of the kids.
I feed off the excitement ofan audience.
Peter, for once, you're going to stay here
and help around the house.
Now, I need you to watch Stewie
till I get back.
Whoever did this, thank you.
All right, Stewie, since Lois says
I got to keep an eye on you,
we might as well have
some father-son time.
So I'm gonna measure your penis
and then I'm gonna measure my penis,
and we're gonna see whose is bigger.
Doesn't really seem fair.
All right, let's see what you got.
Stupid game anyway.
Hey, kids,
coming up next,
it's the "Jolly Farm Revue" marathon.
No, no, don't switch it.
I want to watch Jolly Farm.
Son of a bitch.
I got to spend the rest of the day
watching stupid kid shows.
I'd rather watch paint dry.
Nice.
Wakey, wakey.
Good morning, Mother Maggie.
Huh, who's this? I like this lady.
Hey, do you think Mother Maggie
is married to Father...
Oh, probably not.
And the unicorn slid
down the rainbow to a field of jellybeans
where she and the other villagers
decided it had been the best day ever.
Oh, look, it's Pengrove Pig,
and he's sharing his apples nicely, isn't he?
Like a champ he is.
Head, shoulders, knees and toes
Knees and toes
And that's haw you make a duck
out afan oatmeal container.
This is the greatest show
in the history of television.
Mother Maggie, you are a kindred spirit.
This must be how twins
who were separated at birth
feel when they first meet.
Trade house keys, bang each other's wives?
Yep.
I can't dissect this pig, Mr. Kingman.
It's against my religion.
Believe me, Neil, it's no thrill
for the pig to touch a Jew either.
Okay, how about you, Meg,
how are you doing?
Pretty good.
It's kind of cool cutting
something that's not me.
Wow, that's some very impressive work.
It's easy for Meg to dissect a pig
because she is a pig.
Hey!
All right, I'll let that one slide.
Meg, you have some real potential.
Have you ever thought about becoming
a doctor when you grow up?
Ialways just assumed
I'd work on the docks.
Don't limit yourself, Meg.
Doctors wear a mask most of the time.
So this isn't an issue.
If you're interested,
the school has a program
where you can shadow a real doctor
and learn more about the medical field.
Yeah, wow, l'd love to check that out.
Great, I'll set it up.
I didn't know a pig could be a doctor.
Hey! You get just a few more of those.
How, children,
we're going to learn who wears a hat.
Can a fireman wear a hat?
- No?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Can a policeman wear a hat?
- No way.
- Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.
Yes, he can, I knew that.
How, you at home, tell me,
who else wears a hat?
A very formal horse?
Very good.
Even a bowling ball can wear a hat
if you use your imagination.
A bowling ball wearing a hat?
This is what high-def was invented for.
Peter, what the hell are you doing?
Being a good dad like you asked.
I've been watching Jolly Farm with Stewie
for the last three hours.
That's not Stewie, that's a pineapple.
Oh, my God, where is Stewie?
I don't know, but I'm sure he's fine.
Peter, he's a baby.
You can't leave him alone.
Come on, it's good to have some alone time.
You know, I spent a year alone
on a desert island
with nothing but a monkey
to keep me company.
You're saved, sir.
We're going to get you back to civilization.
And how about we bring along
your monkey pal?
Okay.
Yeah, we can teach him sign language,
and he can tell us stories about what
you two did on the island together.
No, no, no, no, let's... Let's not...
Let's not bring the monkey.
Um, I have a peanut M&amp;M up my nose,
and it's now further up
than my finger can reach.
I am ready to farm this out to someone.
Oh, Stewie, there you are.
Peter, I asked you to do one simple thing.
Watch the baby.
And you couldn't even do that.
Come on, Stewie.
Jeez, why's she got to be such a nag?
I wish she was more like Mother Maggie.
Mother Maggie has an announcement,
lads and lasses.
I've had such fun playing and learning
with you these last few years,
but now, just as bees must leave the hive,
I must leave Jolly Farm.
Not that you asked,
but to have fertility treatments.
So this will be our last episode
of "Jolly Farm."
What? No.
They can't cancel Jolly Farm.
Peter, it's just a stupid kids' show.
Just a stupid kids' show?
What about Pengrove Pig
and the Lollipop Luau?
Uh, I don't know.
This is going to leave a void,
and somebody's got to fill it.
I think you're overreacting.
You don't understand, Brian.
What am I supposed to do
without Jolly Farm?
I'll be like an Italian mom without bad kids.
Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
is all the commotion in here?
We're not doing anything.
You getting fresh with me?
I'm tired of bailing both of yous
out of prison.
We're both in college,
and we consistently make the Dean's List.
- I'm telling your father.
- Good.
Where the hell is our food?
Yeah, where are Mom and Dad?
And where's that awesome finger painting
Stewie did this morning? Oh! Here it is.
Thank you for bringing it up.
I wasn't going to bring it up.
Well, what's going on?
You haven't eaten yet?
- No.
- Where's your father?
He was supposed to put
the lasagna in the oven.
Ugh!
I ask him to do one thing while I'm at yoga.
You go to an intro class,
and it's not even at the yoga studio.
It's in someone's living room.
And that's not even a yoga mat.
That's the old pee pad from my crib.
Uh, Lois, you might want to check this out.
- What is it, Brian?
- Take a look.
And now, boys and girls,
it's time for "Petey's Funhouse."
It's gonna be fun
and we'll have lots of yuks
And maybe learn some stuff
but not definitely
It's the "Petey's Funhouse" show
Ugh, another Aaron Sorkin show
that's way over everyone's head.
How the hell did you
even get a TV show, Peter?
I just answered an ad off Craigslist,
and after several hours of sexual torture,
I had a show.
Don't answer that.
I gave out that number under duress.
Lois, Peter's show is on
the local public access channel.
Anyone can have one.
Yeah, Petey's Funhouse
is actually replacing
The Bad Audio Basement Show.
And once the hot glue dries,
your birdhouse will be complete.
Peter, you already do nothing
around the house,
and now you're wasting
more time with this nonsense.
Geez, you're still getting on my hump
about this?
I help out around here.
Just this morning I changed Meg's diaper
and I sent her off to school.
Boy, can she kick,
but she left here spotless.
Dr. Hartman, thanks for letting me
shadow you.
I just know l'm going to learn so much.
Ah! It's my pleasure, Meg,
and you're in good hands.
You see that diploma? Yale Medical School.
Wow, that's impressive.
Thank you,
I work very hard on my calligraphy.
So, how about we take
a little stroll around the hospital?
This area is known as a hallway.
Don't worry, you'll pick up on all
the technical doctor jargon pretty soon.
Hey, is it prescription or perscription?
I think it's prescription.
Prescription...
That just feels weird in my mouth.
Perscription is better.
Oh, and there's the ER.
Don't go in there unless you want
everyone to yell at you.
Hi, kids, I'm Petey Griffin.
Hi, Petey!
We're going to have so much fun
on Petey's Funhouse today,
but before we begin,
your friend Petey wants to sing you a song.
What makes you so special?
The fact that you are special
But if everybody 's special
That kinda waters it down
So some of you ain't special
I can tell you who is special
Like you and you ain't special
And you are and you're not.
Okay, kids, it's story time here
on Petey's Funhouse.
Today's story is
Lesbian Butts in '80s Jeans.
Oh, that's a classic.
"Once upon a time,
some chick in a leather jacket
"in front of me in the parking lot
"walked into Home Depot,
"and her butt looked like this."
Everybody see this?
Everybody see how shapeless this is?
She walked out of there with a bag
of soil on each shoulder.
Now, before I show you this next one,
has anyone here ever heard
of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally?
I know we have a lot of yuks
here on Petey's Funhouse,
but one thing that's not fun is a bully.
Now, how many of you kids out there
have ever gotten bullied?
Aw, come on up here
and tell us about it, champ.
Well, my name is Winston,
and I'm quite fond of ballet.
One time, I tried out
for Little League in my ballet shoes,
and the other kids made so much fun of me,
I wet my pants.
What, wait, what, like pee?
- How old were you?
- Eight.
Ah! Too old! Too old to be peeing yourself,
Baby Pee Pants.
All right, you kids finish him off.
- Hey, what do you got there?
- Oh, l'm just playing with some Lee Logs.
What the hell are Lee Logs?
A little something I created. Lee Logs.
Robert E. Lee. You know, you got
Lincoln Logs, you got Lee Logs.
I don't get it, can you build a house?
You can build quarters.
And people live there?
They live there if you tell 'em to live there.
I don't know ifl like the idea of Lee Logs.
Yeah, they're not selling very well.
Peter, dinner!
No dinner for me tonight, Lois.
I have to go work on a bit
for tomorrow's show.
If I can kill 25 butterflies in a minute,
I won't have to show the audience my balls.
Peter, this is the fourth night in a row
you've skipped out on us
to work on your show.
Once again, l'm gonna be stuck
cleaning up the kitchen,
helping out with homework,
and bathing Stewie.
You know, l'd lay off the nagging
if I was you.
I'm a children's TV star now.
I can have any three-year-old girl I want.
Just know that, Lois.
Peter, l'm only asking you to do your share.
Well, it's getting on my nerves.
Like, right now, you are the most
annoying thing in my life,
with the possible exception of Evite.
What's this?
It's this website you can use
to invite people to stuff.
Does it have to be a significant event?
No. Not at all!
Well, do you just get the invitation,
and that's the end of it?
No, it'll remind you about it constantly!
Is there any way I can customize this
to showcase my personality
through familiar clip art?
Yes!
And what about those replying?
Can they demonstrate their sense of humor
through hilarious replies?
Yes, yes, yes to everything you're saying!
I'm so excited to get started!
You do that while I jump out this window!
Evite. Tell a friend
and then kill yourself
And then when you get a little older,
stuff will come out.
Uh-oh, sounds like my cranky
new neighbor just got home.
I hope she doesn't come over here
and give me the business.
Peter!
Oh, hi, Saggy Naggy.
Never mind
with "hi!"
It sounds like someone's having
fun over here!
You know I don't like that!
Hey, kids.
Meet Saggy Naggy.
Real nice lady, huh?
No!
What can I do for you, Saggy Naggy?
You can stop
having fun!
But we like fun,
don't we, kids?
Yes!
Well, too bad,
'cause you're all gonna eat your vegetables,
listen to long stories about my cousins,
and help me fold sheets!
And you!
You're gonna help around the house,
take out the garbage,
and give Stewie his bottle!
Yeah, I heard it.
They say my name on TV all the time.
Calm down, bitch.
Make me dinner,
and go rent Twilight,
and do mouth stuff on me,
even though it's been
a day-and-a-half since l've showered,
and l've used several public bathrooms
in the interim!
Sounds like
this could go on for a while, kids.
Hev. Sassy Naggy.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Do you like pie?
I guess.
Well,
how does this taste?
Well, I guess she thought it was
a no-pies-in-the-face kind of neighborhood.
Wrong assessment of the neighborhood,
sweetheart!
And how are you today,
Mr... Pa-ti-ent?
My last name is Saunders.
That's an interesting pronunciation.
This is Meg, she's shadowing me today.
And boy, could she put the applesauce
away in the commissary.
- Hi.
- Little tip, Meg,
the inside of this folder
has a diagram of the human body.
Kind of a cheat sheet.
Now, see, right now,
I'm listening for cancer.
Do you mean his heartbeat?
Maybe. Here, you take a turn.
Wow, your heartbeat sounds a little fast.
- Do you smoke?
- Actually, I do.
Ah! Me, too. lsn't it great?
Well, that's bad for you. You shouldn't do it.
It raises your heart rate
and can lead to emphysema or cancer.
That's impressive, Meg.
It's no big deal.
lt's just stuffl learned in health class.
Well, you're clearly a bright young lady.
And you've got quite a...
Head on your...
Shoulders.
Thanks.
Dr. Hartman, you just got
this urgent message.
Oh, dear. Prilosec, huh?
No, it's below that.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Meg, I'm afraid my brother
just tried to kill himself in prison.
I have to go.
You're gonna have to take things
from here, I guess.
What? What are you talking about?
Well, you now know about as much as I do
about this whole doctor thing.
But I have no formal medical training.
Ah! You'll be fine.
I think that book on the shelf
has most of the stuff in there.
And don't forget the cheat sheet
if you need a helping...
Hand.
Are we really buying fish
at the same place we buy tires?
And, what... "Fazio"?
What, is that a brand of Blu-ray player?
Stewie, this sweatshirt is so sophisticated.
Look, it says "New York."
People will think l'm from there.
Put your phone
away, we're at a funeral!
Oh, my God.
Look! lt's Saggy Naggy.
Boo!
- You're mean.
- I don't like you, Saggy Naggy.
You stink, Saggy Naggy.
My goodness, that's a very rude thing
to say to someone.
Calling them Saggy...
What the hell?
Young man, what do you think you're...
Lois, I just saw Jessica Alba on television.
We've got 90 seconds, let's go!
Peter, I'm not in the mood!
That's okay. We can do it anyway.
Peter, I was assaulted in public
because of you!
Oh, my God, what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
A group of kids attacked me at Costmart
because you portrayed me on your show
as a raging puppet bitch!
Writers take from their lives.
You married a creative type.
You knew this was a risk.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, the last few weeks,
you've been nagging the hell out of me.
Peter, you think I like nagging you?
One of us needs to be
an adult in this marriage,
and it's clearly not you.
Is this about me wetting the bed just now?
Peter, don't you understand that
l'm just looking out for this family?
Besides, without my nagging,
you'd probably get yourself killed.
Or laid.
Right, frat house?
Yeah!
Those knuckleheads
should be studying.
Okay, you know what? Fine, Peter, that's it.
From now on,
l'm not nagging you anymore.
- You're not?
- No, you're on your own.
I'm done with it. I'm done with all of it!
Well, great,
I should probably get some sleep.
Tomorrow on Peteyis Funhouse,
we're doing "Who's on First?"
I'm gonna play Costello,
and Abbott is gonna be played
by a live puma.
Peter, that sounds really...
You know what? Sounds great. Have fun.
Thanks, Lois. Good night.
Lois? Other families fight, too, right?
Not this much.
Do you think maybe we should
think about getting a...
It is what it is.
Let's just get Stewie to college
and go from there.
Sir, if you're gonna want me to examine
where you're having an issue,
you're gonna have to be more specific
than "thingee."
Okay.
It's not the front thingee.
What's going on in here?
Where's Dr. Hartman?
He had a family emergency.
I'm not really a doctor,
but l've been sort of filling in for him.
- You what?
- Well, I think
I want to go into medicine,
so I was shadowing Dr. Hartman.
I've actually been learning a lot,
but then he just left me here!
Well, you don't belong here!
This is a professional medical institution
with standards and regulations
to adhere to!
But... Butl...
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I'm sorry. I'll go.
My issue has resolved itself.
And don't go anywhere, kids.
'Cause coming up,
we got some classic comedy
with me and a puma.
ls Dad really gonna do this?
I told your father
I was gonna leave him alone.
Saggy Naggy is keeping out of this.
Is the puma ready?
Maybe we should poke him with
the "is-the-puma-ready?" stick.
Oh, my God, I can't let him do this!
Come on, kids!
We got to get down to that TV studio!
Okay, yeah, just step on the coloring book.
That's cool.
I'm asking you who's on first!
Oh, my God! Peter!
Cut the camera! Cut it!
Roll a Petey Learn-A-Long Song!
Kentucky is a state
Kentucky is a state
All the people there are dicks
Kentucky is a state
Oh, he's hurt bad. Someone call 911!
He's bleeding too much!
He needs attention now!
Somebody help him! Do something!
Now she's nagging everyone.
Does anyone have any medical training?
It looks like his jugular is severed.
I learned this at the hospital.
Mr. Swanson, find me a first aid kit!
Mom, hand me those towels.
Did I hold on to the ball?
Hang in there, Dad.
I'm gonna get you fixed up.
You can do it, Meg.
Come on, Meg. You got to save him!
Peter, you need to let go.
Lois?
Oh! Peter, thank God! You're okay.
I guess you were right about that puma.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I should've listened to you.
Peter, I don't care about that.
I acted like a real jerk, and l'm sorry, Lois.
I know you just get on my case
'cause you're looking out for me.
I am, Peter. And it's only because I love you,
and I want the best for you and our family.
I love you, too, Lois.
Isn't anybody gonna thank me?
Yeah, I'll have a water if you're getting one.
Mr. Griffin, you have a visitor.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I get it now. "Who" is the man's name.
A-ha!
</div>\t'
