# It seems today
# That all you see
# Is violence in moviesand sex on TV
# But where are those goodold-fashioned values
# On which we used to rely?
# Lucky there's a family guy
# Luckily there's a man whopositively can do
# All the things that make us# Laugh and cry
# He's a family guy #
Ah! It smells so good out here.
You see, Peter? This is a muchbetter way to spend a Sunday
than what you dragged usto last week.
If I'm starring in a production
of Starlight Express,I want my whole family there.
CHANTING: Starlight Express!Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!Starlight Express!
Starlight Express!
(VENOMOUS) Starlight Express.Starlight Express.
Starlight Express.Starlight Express.
Starlight Express.Starlight Express.
(GASPS) Stewie, look! A butterfly!
Let's get it! (CACKLES)
Uh...Chris? I don't thinkwe should be leaving the trail.
(GIGGLES) I shall put you in a glassbox to display on St Trimmins Day.
(WHINES) British guysalways capture my butterflies.
Yes. And to add insult to injury,I shall present to you my fanny,
Sir Chadwell Heath.(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
Oh, darnit.
Hey, wait a second. Where are we?
Oh, no.
Hey, Chris. Do you know your backnespells Citibank in braille?
Great.You had to chase the butterfly!
Yes, I had to chase the butterfly.
I came out here to observe nature.What did you come out here for?
I came to the woods becauseI wished to live deliberately,
and see if I could not learnwhat it had to teach,
and not, when I came to die,discover that I had not lived.
Wow, Stewie. That was beautiful.
Did you write that?No.
But can you tell me who did?Log on now!
(CHEESY MUSIC)
All right!Let's tally up those responses.
Wow. You know who that is?You know who Thornton Mell-
First of all,it was Henry David Thoreau.
Do you know who Thornton Mellon is?
That was Rodney Dangerfield'scharacter in Back To School.
You feel good about yourselves? Huh?
This is why the other countriesare beating us, you know!
So you've got only yourself to blamenext time you to go the vet
and complain that that Indian doctoris too rough with your cat.
(SOBS SOFTLY)
Oh, Stewie. Are we gonna die?
Hey, hey... Probably.
I...I don't wanna die.
You know, Chris, if by some miracle
we do manage toget out of here alive,
I'm gonna finally runfor public office again.
I think people have forgottenmy last embarrassment.
Harry Truman. Stupid jerk.
Freakin' FDR's ass-bitch.
If we get back home alive,
I'm gonna finally open up to Ellenfrom my math class
and tell her how much I like her.
I'd like those things for us, Chris.
What are you doing?I'm digging a hole.
Why?Cos I like to sleep on my side.
'Our top story. The search fortwo local boys lost in the woods
drags on into its third day.'
'That's right, Diane. Still no signof Chris and Stewie Griffin.
Here's the updatefrom the local authorities
who are overseeingthe search party's efforts.'
'We're still very optimisticthat we're gonna find these kids,
and we just wanna urge everyonenot to give up hope.'
'All right, everyone. We areofficially looking for corpses.
Repeat,this is now a recovery effort.
We are officiallylooking for corpses,
so let's get back out there,bring back those dead bodies.'
Oh, God! This is horrible.I can't watch any more.
Mom, Daddy, thank you so muchfor coming over.
Oh, of course, dear.I don't know what to do.
They've scoured the areaand there's no sign of them.
I feel like I can't justsit here doing nothing
but I don't know what I CAN do.
I'll tell you who can help. Medium.
Daddy, that's not a real person.That's a character on a TV show.
Don't you disparage Medium!Medium works very hard!
Mom, I saw this thingon the Discovery Channel
about psychics who helpfind people who are lost.
Really? I saw this thingon the Discovery Channel
about this fat woman who sat on adog and it went up inside her guts.
It's been three days and I justdon't know where else to turn.
Please, can you help me?
Don't worry, Lois. The spirit worldwants very much to assist you.
Your missing sons will be found.
Oh! Oh, thank you!
Thank you so much!
I can't tell youhow reassuring that is.
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)My babies are OK!
Will you answer one question for me?
Yes.Thank you so much.
(HOARSE) Well, Stewie...I think we're finished.
(WEAKLY) It sure looks that way.
It's been a pleasureserving with you, Chris.
And with you, Stewie.
Jeffrey! Jeffrey, come back!It's gonna get dark soon!
All this dramaover a turkey burger?
(GASPS) Oh, thank God!
Oh, you're not Jeffrey.You're that missing baby and boy.
(GASPS) Jeffrey!I found that missing baby and boy!
JEFFREY: I don't care!
(BOTH GASP)CHRIS AND STEWIE: Mommy!
Chris! Stewie! My babies!
Oh, I'm so happy you're safe!
Oh, I knew they'd find you.I knew you were OK.
It's just like the psychic said.
Thank you all for your help,everybody.
GERMAN ACCENT: Oh, for definite!It's just like a childhood game
of Hide And Find.You said it, friend.
What do you say for celebration wego dunk our whistles in the trough?
Oh! We should totally phone Gaspard!Oh! He would love to hear this tale!
Oh, but I only have 15 pfennigson my phone card.
Happy Gerbitz Day!
Oh! Oh!Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, it is so good to have my boysback home safe and sound!
Thank God for that psychic.
What are you talking about?She didn't do anything.
Well, she said we were gonnafind them and we did.
I always wondered aboutpsychics,
but I gotta tell you,I'm a believer now.
I'm gonna go back and seewhat else she has to say.
Hey, check it out! Chris and Stewieare on the front page of the paper.
You know, Chris,that girl from school
sees that picture and you are in.
Look, Stewie,I'm not really gonna ask her out.
I think that just might have beencocky forest talk.
You've gotta take advantage of this!
Seize your moment,like the duck founding father.
Gentlemen, these are allimportant fundamental rights.
But I move we strike the rightto bob for small fish
with your butt in the air.
All in favour?ALL: Aye!
Opposed?(DUCK QUACKS)
The motion carries.
I don't know about this, Stewie.Nonsense. You're a hero now.
Your picture's in the paper.She'll be fawning all over you.
Now, which one is she?There.
Hi, Chris.Wait a minute. That's the girl?
Yeah. Isn't she special?
That's the way the state ofRhode Island would put it.
There's something...up with her,isn't there?
Yeah. She's got Down syndrome.OK. Well, there we go.
She's so sweet. And doesn't she havethe most beautiful eyes?
Well, the spacing seems a tad off,but individually, they're not awful.
All right. I'm on board.Go talk to her.
Um...
Hi, Ellen.Hi, Chris.
Um...this is my little brother,Stewie.
Your head makes me laugh.
I'm guessing this one owned a bunny,but not any more.
(THUD)Um...listen.
There's something I've wanted totell you for a really long time.
Oh, yeah? What?Well um...
I really like you.(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
And I was wondering if maybe um...
you wanna go out on a date with me?
OK. Pick me up Saturday at eight.
Great! See you then!
There you go! Being confident.
Like an Italian guy in any giventheoretical situation.
If that was me...
I'm just saying, if that was me,they are lucky that was NOT me,
because if the circumstances weresuch as you have described them
but with me in them,
that's a very different and scaryoutcome for those involved.
If.
Oh, my God. Brian! Oh, my God.What? What is it? What happened?
I just went to see my psychic,Estelle,
and she told me that Stewie is gonnagrow up to be very successful!
Isn't that great news?
You went to see that psychic again?That's the third time this week.
She's a lifesaver, Brian!
She gives me the confidenceto live my life,
knowing I'm makingthe right choices.
Wow! And she does all this for free?No. She charges me.
She charges you? Well, that's weird.
Why would you pay her to hear thingsyou wanna hear (?)
I'm not crazy about your tone,Brian.
Well, I just think you're beingtaken for a ride, Lois.
Like a snail on the backof a turtle.
Slow down! I wanna get there,but I wanna get there alive!
(CRICKETS CHIRP)
Mom, why do I have totake a bath with Stewie?
Because, Meg, Estelle told methat someone in the family was
in danger of drowning and that Ishould take steps to prevent it.
So from now on,everybody has a bath buddy.
Hey, Meg. Watch.(FARTS)
(GIGGLING)(FARTS)
(LAUGHTER)(FARTS)
(SCREAMS)
What am I gonna do?
I'm erally nervous about my datewith Ellen tonight.
I mean, I wanna impress her, but...
What if I mess things up?Oh, come on, Chris!
It's jut a matter of getting offon the right foot.
First things first,let's get you lookin' sharp.
(JAUNTY MUSIC)
# You've got to lookyour best tonight
# You tubby little parasite
# Cos there's a lovely ladyand she's waiting for you
# And though her pretty facemay seem
# A special person's wettest dream
# Before you get to see itthere are things you must do
# We'll try a tie
# And boutonniere of yellow
# Or a rose that shows
# That you're a classy fellow
# With the posh panache
# Of Jefferson at Monticello
# Busting out a mile with style
# I know you justcan't wait to stare
# At all that luscious orange hair
# But, boy, before you toucha single curl
# You must impress thatultra-boomin'
# All-consumin' poorly-groomin'
# Down syndrome girl
# On any normal day you reek
# As if you're on a farting streak
# Your finger's up your nose
# And you are dripping with drool
# But if you want a lady's love
# You're better off by smelling of
# A gentleman's cologneinstead of sneakers and stool
# A squirt, a spurt
# Of something just for Ellen
# And you'll see that she
# Will find you so compellin'
# And she does because the onlysmell that she'll be smellin'
# Won't be coming from your bum... #(FARTS)
# You wanna take that little whore
# And spin her on the dancing floor
# But, boy,before you do a single twirl
# You must impress that effervescing
# Self-possessing, no BS-ing
# Down syndrome girl
(MUSIC SLOWS TO A WALTZ)
# Her eyes are emerald portals
# To a secret land of love
# And her smile is likethe sweetest summer flower
# Her kiss is so inviting
# And her hugs are so delighting
# And what makes them really niceis that they've got a little spice
# Because they're tighterthan a vice
# And they go on for an hour... #
(TAPDANCING)
# My boy, between the two of us
# We'll get you on that shorty bus
# And then you're gonna take itfor a whirl
# Now go impress thatsuper-thrilling
# Wish-fulfilling, Yoo-Hoo-spilling# Ultra-swinging, boner-bringing
# Gaily-singing, ding-a-ling-ing
# Stupefying, fortifying# As of Monday, shoelace-tying
# Stimulating, titillating# Kitty-cat-impersonating
# Mega-rocking, pillow-talking# Just a little crooked-walking
# Coyly-pouting, poopy-sprouting# For some reason always shouting
# Fascinating, captivating# Happiness and joy-creating... #
(GLASS SMASHES)# Down syndrome girl #
OK, Brian, I'm here.Now, what is it you want?
Look, Lois, this psychic nonsensehas gone too far.
So I'm gonna prove to youthat there is no such thing
as someone who is psychic, and thatwith the most minimal training
and the right set of buzzwords,anyone can appear to be psychic.
Even a complete boob like Peter.Watch this.
Excuse me, ma'am.I'm psychic,
and I'm getting a strong feelingfrom you.
Do you have a watch or clockthat no longer works?
Wow!I used to have a watch that broke.
You see, just by askingvery general questions
that would apply to most people,
a person can appear to haveinside knowledge about you.
I'm also sensing that you havea dead relative.
My husband died of cancer last year.Oh, my God! Awesome.
OK, I'm sensingsome other bad stuff.
My daughter was just in an accident.Sweet! High five!
(GASPS) You're awful!
Hey. You don't wanna hear the truth,don't come to the park.
OK, OK. You made your point.I get it.
Maybe I went a little overboardwith the things Estelle told me.
All right.Look, can we just go home now?
Come on, Peter. Let's go.Brian...
I felt something just now,talking to that bitch cancer widow.
I think...I may have a gift.
Peter, we were just doinga demonstration -
No, Brian. This is real.
I believe I am psychic.
My first prediction:I am either gonna fly,
or ruin that family's picnic.
Hey! You've ruined our picnic!
Psychic!
Peter, what are you doing?Quiet, Brian.
I'm performing a psychic reading.
Peter, for the last time,you're not psychic.
I most certainly am!
All right, Quagmire. Clear your mi-Ooh, soft hands!
Clear your mind, remove all tracesof unease and doubt,
and I will tell you your future.
What is it, Peter?
You will die in a plane crash and bereincarnated as a prophylactic.
All right!
No! No! Not all right!
Well, I'm glad we're finallygoing out, Ellen.
I've really liked youfor a long time.
Hey! What the helldo you think you're doing?
Sitting down?Get up and pull my chair out for me.
Oh, goodness! I'm sorry.
So sorry.That's better.
You gonna be this rude all evening?
You haven't asked meanything about myself.
(GASPS) Oh um... Sorry.
Uh...so, what do your parents do?
That's better.My dad is an accountant
and my mom is the formerGovernor of Alaska.
Oh, that's cool.It's real cool.
Now, get up, come over here,and give me a shoulder massage.
OK.
Boy, you're tougher thana doggy dominatrix.
Do it. Do it. Come on, do it.Do it. Do it!
(SCREAMS) Yes! Yes!
Oh, you bitch! Ah!
Oh, my God. This is awful!There's gotta be 200 people here.
(OMINOUS MUSIC)(APPLAUSE)
Thank you.Thank you so much for coming.
Thank... (GASPS) Hold on.I'm sensing something psychic.
Ma'am, did you havea female relative
who's passed on to the other sidenamed...
Um... Polly?Polly! I said it first.
(APPLAUSE)That was amazing!
I've never seen a bad showat the Marriott.
Oh, my God. They're allfalling for this insanity!
I'm sensing a black guy over here.Is there a black guy?
Me! I'm a black guy!(GASPS AND APPLAUSE)
Yes. Good, good. I'm sensingyour infant daughter has earrings.
He's right! She does!
(Peter!You gotta stop this right now.)
Shut up, Lois.Don't mess up my psychic-ness.
I'm sensing a doctor inthe audience. Where is the doctor?
I'm a doctor. Your great-grandmotheris contacting me right now,
and she wants to know if this rashlooks like it's gonna go away.
Well, I...I guess I'd tell herto use Bactine.
No! She says Bactine hurts.She wants something more soothing.
(AUDIENCE GASP)Peter, we need your help.
We just got word of a kidnap victim
buried alive with a bombstrapped to his chest.
We need your psychic powers to leadus to him before the bomb goes off.
Well, well. Finally,a true test of my abilities.
You came to the right place, Joe.I'll psych that guy out for you.
Peter, you can't do this.I mean, it's one thing to take money
from a bunch of suckers,but this is serious.
You're a fraud.I am not!
I'll tell you who's a fraud.Mr Spock.
Mr Sulu, set a course for -One moment, Captain.
They're about to announcethe numbers
for the intergalactic lottery.
'Today's winning numbers are18, 24, 41 and 72.'
(SCREAMS) Yes!You're damn right! Hell, yeah!
You can suck it! You can suck it!
You can suck it!You can all suck it!
Live long and suck it!
Well, Ellen, I had a reallyinteresting time with you tonight.
I...I guess I'll talk to you soon.
You're not leaving yet.
I need somebody to make mean ice cream sundae.
So get in the house!OK, OK...
Uh...unless you're gonna pulla sundae out of your belly button,
I'd get your assin the (BLEEP) kitchen.
(SIGHS) Oh, boy.
My dogs are mooing today.
No, no, no, no, no, no.What's the matter?
Did I say,"Put chocolate sauce on there"?
Did you hear me say,"Put chocolate sauce on there"?
Well, I just thought that -You thought what?
You know,if you want access to this temple,
you'd better pay the proper tribute.
All right, that is it!I don't care how hot you are!
I don't much likebeing treated this way.
You know, I used to hearthat people with Down syndrome
were different than the rest of us,but you're not.
You're not different at all!
You're just a bunch of (BLEEP)like everyone else!
I got bad news for you, buddy.
You just blew it.Get out of my house, now!
How'd it go? Looks likeI totally screwed that up.
No, you didn't. You made a vowthat you were gonna ask Ellen out
and you did.That took courage, my friend.
Especially for a poor,timid sap like you.
I'm proud of you!Thanks, Stewie.
I'm just sorry I never got tomake out with her.
She would have crushed your scroteinto a diamond
with her robot-strength hand.Come on, let's get out of here.
All right, Peter. We know the victimis somewhere in this area.
We don't have much timebefore the bomb - Shh, shh, shh.
OK, Joe. When I'm tracking someone,it often helps to touch something
that belongs to the victim.Does he have a wife? Uh...yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. It's still very fuzzy.
Does he have a daughter?
Yeah, I see. Does he have maybe,like, a thinner, hotter daughter?
Yes, but she's only 12.OK, but, like, a young 12?
Or, like,she eats a lot of milk products
so she got her boobs early 12?Which is a real thing, by the way.
Peter, we're running out of time!All right. We'll try something else.
I will now use my psychic powersto seek help from beyond.
I shall now channelthe ghost of Lou Costello,
who will guide us tothis soul in distress.
(AS LOU COSTELLO) Hi, everybody!It's me, Lou Costello.
What's the name of the guy?He's an Asian fellow, Melvin Hu.
That's what I wanna find out. What?The name of the guy. Melvin Hu.
Are you a cop? Yeah.You handling this case? Yeah.
What's the name of the guy? Hu.The guy we're looking for. Hu!
The guy who's buried? Hu!The guy with the bomb! Hu!
What street does he live on?First. (EXPLOSION)
Yeah, I'm not psychic.
