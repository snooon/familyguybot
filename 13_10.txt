&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Hey Lois, can I pleasehave another pancake?
(laughs)What? What's so funny?
I don't know.Dog eating pancakes.
It's funny.
Mom, I need a checkfor the school field trip.
Geez, Meg, didn't I justtake you on a field trip?
Okay, here's the field!Good-bye forever!
(engine revving,tires squealing)
Aah! Meg, I'm injured!
Please help me!
I smell gas!
Meg, I'm still alive,but I'm badly burned!
Come save my life andnurse me back to health!
Oh, God, why do bad thingshappen to good people?!
Here, sweetie, I'llwrite you a check.
No, no, I got it, Lois.
Let me just lick my thumb
'cause that's what people dobefore they write a check.
Okay, now let me tilt my glassesdown and ask the date.
What's the date today?
Dad, why don't your checkshave any writing on them?
Why don't your shelveshave any trophies on 'em?
I've obviouslycaught you at a bad time.
Lois, why don't my checkshave any writing on them?
Well, Peter...What?
That's just a wide padof Post-its I gave you.
What?!So that million dollar check
you gave me yesterdayis no good?
I quit my job, man!
I will not see you Monday!
What the hell, Lois?
Why don't I havea real checkbook?
Peter, where dochecks come from?
Uh... when a mommy and daddylove each other?
That's why.
Lois, I want my own checkbook,and I want it now!
Ooh, I likewhen Dad talks tough.
He sounds likeDirty Harry.
You got to ask yourselfone question.
"Do I feel lucky?"
Well, do ya, punk?
Oh, Mr. Harry,
you're really not gonna likewhat I have to say.
Hi. What can Ido for you?
Yes, I was wondering,where is the room
where I can roll around nudewith my money?
I'm sorry?
No, I'm sorry.I thought this was a bank.
I'll handle this.
My husband wants toopen a checking account.
Okay, well, first,I'll need to see a photo I.D.
and a birth certificate.
Of course.
I keep all my importantpapers in my bosom.
Okay, "Justin...Peter... Griffin."
It's actuallyjust Peter Griffin.
So, this is not yourbirth certificate?
Oh, my God!
Your first nameis Justin?!
It is?!
Wow, I never noticed that!
"Justin Griffin."
Huh, I likethe sound of that.
I'm a Justin!
This is awesome!This changes everything!
Peter, it doesn'tchange a thing.
You're stillthe exact same person.
I beg to differ.
MAN (on TV):And now, international newsfrom Al Jarreau Jazeera.
&#9834; Car bombing in Syria &#9834;
&#9834; Skididdly boom-bopa dee, yeah &#9834;
&#9834; 37 people killed &#9834;
&#9834; Ooh, the peopleare dead. &#9834;
Hey, Lois, you seenmy hiking boots?
I need 'em laterfor park soccer.
Peter, why the helldo you look like that?
Uh, my nameisn't Peter.
My name is Justin.
I'm living a Justin lifestyle,and so is my family.
You want to go toa concert? Huh?
Want to go to aloud concert?
No.
Since I'm your coolfather Justin,
we should bond withskin-to-skin contact.
How about Justintakes his shirt off,
and we can get some photosof you on Justin's belly?
Your heartbeat is weird.
It is notconsistent at all.
Okay, let's go for aride in my open Jeep.
I took the doors off,so it's extra terrifying.
Geez, this "Justin" phaseof Dad's is kind of weird.
Eh, not as weird ashis karaoke phase.
Peter, did you throw upin the sink?
("Baba O'Riley" begins to play)
Peter?
&#9834; &#9834;
&#9834; &#9834;
&#9834; &#9834;
(drums kick in)
&#9834; Out herein the fields &#9834;
Yeah, that was me, I was the onewho threw up in the sink.
&#9834; I farmfor my meals... &#9834;
Dad, what are youdoing in here?
Oh, hey, Chris.
I just figured nowthat I'm Justin,
I should starta "Sweet News" wall
for stuff I thinkis totally sweet.
Big puffy cloudsare very sweet.
Big hamburgers.
Small hamburgers, too.
Sliders, I thinkthey're called.
Ranch.
Here's just apicture of a vest.
Pretty sweet.
Palm trees are very sweet,'cause, like, the beach.
This is my room, Dad.
The band Guster is thesweetest band of all time.
It was tough, 'cause I hadto move all my O.A.R. stuff
to fit the Guster stuff.
Peter, get outof Chris's room.
Oh, hey, Mama.
Hey, you seen my copyof Into the Wild?
I like to have it onmy person at all times,
in case I need aquick "inspo sesh."
Oh, did I tell you I'm gonnabe doing a lot of abbreve's?
Peter, you soundlike an idiot.
And did you put a skateboardin the washing machine?
It's gonna cost severalhundred dollars to repair.
How we do, Lois.
All we do.
You ever get in thepocket of a wave?
Peter, you knowI haven't.
And I know for a factthat you haven't, either.
In the pocket.
Some gnarlies out there.
Some "gnar-gnars."
Was in one today.
It's like the rest ofthe world just shuts off,
and all that mattersis you and Lady Blue.
And you know whatshe said to me?
"You're great."
Keep it cool, Lois.
K-E-W-L.
(dance music pulses)
So, you want togo upstairs?
Sure.
Great.
Go.
Hey, Justin, I wantedto introduce you to Keira.
She's the one who broughtfour loose Sierra Nevadas.
Keira!
You totally rockfor bringing those.
Peter, what the hellis going on?!
Oh, dude, is that your mom?
No, I'm not his mom,you little bastard.
That "little bastard" knows howto smoke pot out of an apple.
All right,everyone out of here.
I've had enough ofthis "Justin" nonsense.
Tomorrow we'regoing to city hall
to legally change yourname back to "Peter."
All right, fine.
But I got to say, being Justinwas quite an adventure.
Like when I foundwhere the Wild Things were.
(gun fires)
I owe you, Max.
You led me right to 'em.
All right, now help me grindtheir horns into boner pills.
Keira, that wasan amazing night.
Sorry I can'tdrive you to work.
I gotta go sit in myden until you leave.
Oh, that's okay.
I'll just takethe school bus.
Wait... what?!
You-you drivea school bus?
(giggling): No, silly,I take the bus.
I'm in high school.
What the hell?!
You said you were 23!
Yeah, and you saidyou loved me.
Well, I guess yougot me there.
(knocking on door)
Hey, Quagmire,sorry to bother you,
but we're following upon a tip.
Did you have sexwith this underage girl?
I don't want to go to jail, butI really want to take credit.
Quagmire, I'm afraid you'reunder arrest for statutory rape.
(sighs)
All right, but let mejust send the pictures
I took of her last nightto all my friends.
(cell phone buzzes)
Oh, yeah!
Boom!
You're disgusting.
Take him away.
We've got all the awesomeevidence we need.
(doorbell rings)
"Hello, my name isGlenn Quagmire.
"I am a neighbor of yourson Spooner Street.
I am here to inform youthat I am a sex offender."
It seems as though you couldhave had some of that memorized.
Glenn, what thehell's going on?
It turns outthat girl I took home
from Peter's party last nightis in high school.
Oh, my God!
Does this mean you're gonna moveto Europe to make movies?
How in the world did younot know she was underage?
Well, in retrospect,she did ask a lot of questions
about To Kill a Mockingbird.
Should have senther my way.
I love that book.
Oh, Gregory Peck-- whew!
Anyway, now I gottago in front of a judge.
Really?
Number one or number two?
Our judicial systemis so broken.
No, Peter-- Glennhas to go to court.
That's right.
And there's not even a defensefor statutory rape.
Once the girl proves her age,that's it-- you're guilty.
You know whatI tried today?
A fig.
I have a hearingtomorrow morning.
I may haveto go to jail.
My only hope for leniency isto bring in character witnesses
and show the court I'm notthe monster they say I am.
Well, Peter would behappy to support you.
Yeah, you betcha,Quagmire.
I'm very persuasive.
That's why I was so good
at selling low-costcar insurance.
(chanting): White-trash ratesfrom an army guy.
Here is a penguin,don't know why.
ANNOUNCER:The General Car Insurance.
It'll worry whoever you hit.
I can't believe Quagmireand that girl had sex.
Which is hugging someonereally hard with your legs.
Nope.
Well, you'll tell meif I get it, though, right?
Yeah, I'll tellyou if you get it.
Okay, I'm gonnaget it.
Now, Mr. Griffin,I understand you're here
to speakon Mr. Quagmire's behalf.
That's right,Your Honor.
And as we know, accordingto Game of Thrones,
if the girl has had herblood, she is good to go.
Has the girl had her blood?
Answer the question.
Mr. Griffin, she was underage.
Yes, however, Mr. Quagmirewas born on February 29th.
Ergo, he's only 12.
Ergo, the girl raped him.
Argo, Ben Affleck.
Mr. Griffin,do you have any evidence
that is not basedon film or television?
I don't know.Why don't you ask
all these lettersto Santa Claus?
Something's going on.
We haven't gottenmail in a week.
I-- I haven't gottenmail in a week.
Nobody writes you.
Officer Swanson, I'll remind youthat you are under oath.
Now, please tell us
what Mr. Quagmire saidhe did with the girl.
(sighs)He, uh,
said he gave her a Frosty Jim.
And can you pleaseexplain to the courtroom
what a Frosty Jim is.
Uh...
Sir, you're under oath.
Well, it's when youurinate in a condom,
and tie it off, freeze it,
and then the woman, um,
pretends it's a man.
Thank you.He's a good guy!
Mr. Brown, can you please stateyour occupation for the court?
Aw, come on, man, you didn'task anyone else to do that!
Why am I on trial?!
He's the one that mushedhisself on a child!
When are we gonna seethis chick?
Okay, enough! No more help!
I'm taking this Bible.
You want to know what kindof person Glenn Quagmire is?
You want to knowwhat made me the person I am?
Then put me on the stand.
Lois, can I playAngry Birds on your phone?
Okay, but onlywith the sound off.
Fine. I'll just do itwith my mouth.
Pa-shooo!
(imitates explosion)
(oinking)
Please, go ahead,Mr. Quagmire.
Look, I know everyone's sittingout there judging me today.
But before you do, please know
I had it prettyrough growing up.
My dad was a military man,so he wasn't around much.
And my mom, well,let's just say,
she was a little promiscuous.
In fact, I think my problemsstarted the day I was born.
Wah! Wah! Wah!
It's a boy,Mrs. Quagmire.
Oh, that's wonderful!
How do you feel?
Horny. Really horny.
Could you put him backso I can push him out again?
I was born nine times that day.
And things never got easier.
The only way I learnedmy ABC's was by learning
the names of all the guysmy mom slept with.
&#9834; Art, Bob, Chet,Don, Ed, Frank, Gus &#9834;
&#9834; Hal, Irv, John, Ken,Lew-Matt-Ned-Ox-Pat &#9834;
&#9834; Quint, Ron, Sam,Tom, Ulf, Vic &#9834;
&#9834; Walter, Xavier,Yaz and Zeke &#9834;
&#9834; Those are justsome of the guys &#9834;
&#9834; There are lotsof other guys. &#9834;
It was awful.
I didn't even get to goto my high school prom.
But my mom did.
(doorbell rings)
Hey, is Crystal ready?
Oh, hi, Ronnie.
Hey, listen, have my momhome by midnight, okay?
How about I plow her in the limoand have her home in 20 minutes?
Ah, come on, Ronnie,she bought the dress.
So, you see, Your Honor,thanks to my mom,
I never had a chance tobe like everyone else.
My misguided carnal instinctsare the result
of being raisedby a sexual deviant.
All I'm asking isthat you give me
the break thatmy childhood never did.
Dairy Queen closesin ten minutes.
Mr. Quagmire,your story is a sad one,
but that doesn'texcuse your actions.
I have no choice but to sentenceyou to 20 years in prison.
(gallery gasps)
WOMAN:Oh, no, you don't!
Mom?!
MEN:Crystal?
Ha! She's enjoyed many men.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Do you know I'm carryingthree handguns,
and the metal detectorspicked up nothing?
Your Honor,as the defendant's mother,
I ask that you showmercy on him.
Well, as the victim's mother,I ask that you go to hell!
CHRIS: Where isyour daughter?
Show her to us!
Your Honor,I have renounced my sinful past,
and have been washedin the blood
of the Lord Jesus Christ.
You what?!
I have seenthe righteous path
of our Savior,and ask that you
not sentence my son to jail,
but instead release himto my custody so that I,
with God's guidance,can rehabilitate him.
Wow, Quagmire's mom isa Jesus freak.
I haven't beenthis surprised since we went
to that restauranton my birthday.
All right, guys, let's paythe check and get out of here.
&#9834; Happy birthday to you &#9834;
You guys!
&#9834; Happy birthday to you &#9834;
&#9834; Happy birthday, dear Peter &#9834;
&#9834; Happy birthday to you. &#9834;
Aren't you gonna blow outyour candles, Peter?
Mom, I think something'swrong with Dad.
Peter? Peter?!
Oh, my God! Help!
Someone call 911!
It's okay, ma'am.
This happens here atBennigan's all the time.
How long does this last?
Hard to say.
It's best to just move on.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Quagmire,but my sentence stands.
20 years.
Mr. Quagmire,I'll give you 24 hours
to get your affairs in order.
Oh, my God.
Ah, don't thinkof it as 20 years.
Think of itas two ten-year-olds,
you sick freak.
God, 20 years.
I know this isa hard time for you,
but you needto seek forgiveness.
You need to kneel before Jesus.
Oh, he's gonna be kneelingin front of a lot of guys,
but I doubthe'll catch their names.
It's usually somebody pushingyour skull in the dark.
There are reallyno introductions.
Remember, He isinside you all the time.
Oh, n-now she'sjust setting me up.
Right?
How dare you come in here
and tell me to seek forgiveness!
Where do you get off?!
Pretty mucheverywhere, I hear.
Fat man's right--they're making this easy.
You've never apologized oncefor the way you raised me!
You're the one whomade me what I am!
Oh, come on, Quagmire,you're a grown man,
responsible for his own choices.
Seems kind of cowardly to blamesomeone else for your problems.
Brian abandonedhis own son, by the way.
Why are you, of all people,defending a religious nut?
Aren't you an atheist?
Yeah, it's crazy.
You can think about thatwhile you're in jail.
Glenn, we're notgoing to get anywhere
questioning God's wisdom.
He has a plan for everything.
Oh, now I get it.
That's why you found God.
So you can absolve yourselfof any responsibility
and answer everythingwith empty platitudes.
Face it, you're a worse parent
than Brad Pittand Angelina Jolie.
I'm concerned about Pax,Maddox, and Shiloh.
They're havingtrouble adapting.
They've been raisedwith 11 languages,
and really don't speak any.
I hear you, Doctor.
So... you're saying we shouldgive them all faux-hawks?
No. I think they needintensive therapy.
Let me see if I understand you.
Even shorter on the sides?
Don't you see?
This is your chance to openyour heart and let God in.
I know this jail sentenceseems long.
But salvation canlast all eternity.
You know what elselasts an eternity?
This conversation.
And maybe through our sharedrelationship with the Lord,
we can begin to builda bond as mother and son.
"Mother and son"?!
Mothers love their children!
They nurture themand protect them!
You've never donea thing for me!
I'd rather rot injail than sit here
and listen to all your crap!
(door opens, closes)
(sighs)Glenn's right.
I was never there for him.
I've got to findsome way to fix this.
Did you hear aboutyour ex-husband yet?
He had a... uh, procedure.
You know, some families taketheir baby to the zoo.
That's also a fun activity.
I'm really gonnamiss all you guys.
And I'll think of you wheneverI choke on a link sausage.
Take care, buddy.
(engine revs, tires screech)Oh, yeah!
Fresh air! Freedom!
Peter, while I'm away,
I want you to hold onto myantique, gold Rolex watch.
Oh, cool, a throwing watch!
No, no, Peter, it--
and I cannot stressthis enough--
it is not a throwing watch.
Oh, I hear you, Quagmire.
It didn't come back,like you said it would.
(sighs)
And-and, Joe, yousure you don't mind
taking care of my cat?
Oh, no, all taken care of.
Brought herto the pound this morning.
She went peacefully.
What?! No!
I-I-I meant, take care ofher, like, look after her!
Well, that seems likea note for this morning.
You know, maybe I won't missyou people as much as I thought.
Do you have anythingfor me, Glenn?
What? No! Wha-what?!
I just found out my cat died!
Hmm. I can't help but thinkthis selfish attitude
is part of what got you here.
Good-bye, Glenn. Be strong.
We'll keep you in our thoughts.
Oh, y-you better get rid of that
before you get in there.
All right.
Good-bye, everybody.
And-and don't worry about me.
I-I'll see you real soon.
Hey, you guys take good care
of my child rapist friend!
(tires screech)
Mr. Quagmire, wait!
Judge?!
What are you doing here?
I wanted to tell youthe good news in person.
Your sentencehas been commuted.
You will not be servingprison time after all.
You got a good body, man.
Why do you hide itunder that robe?
"Commuted"?
I don't understand.
Hello, Glenn.
Mom?!
What's going on here?
By the way, Your Honor,your fly is down.
Well, let's just say somenew DNA evidence was produced.
And an impressive amount,I'd say.
PETER:Guy takes care of himself.
Anyway, you're free to go.
You... you're kidding!
Mom... di-did you...?
Yep. Twice.
But I-I thought youwere Christian now.
Helping my son is the mostChristian thing I could do.
You were right, Glenn.I was a terrible mother.
I wasn't there for youwhen I should've been.
But I'd love a second chance.
I'd like that.
I'd like that very much.
Aw, Quagmire got away with it,and learned nothing.
That's great. </div>\t'
