Tell him about the stitches thingwhen Chris was born.
I'll tell it. Lois was so wrecked,
they had to sew her up and opena new vagina next to the first one.

and you're like, "I can't believeI used to use the old one.
Looks so unsafe."All right, enough clowning around.

You son of a bitch!What about my cave in the yard?

I served in the fictitious military.
Peter!Oh, my God, are you all right?
What happened? Where am I?
Who are you?I'm Lois.
Lois who? Who the hell am I?
Uh-oh.
Mrs Griffin,I'm afraid your husband has amnesia.
Oh, my God! Is it permanent?
Well, there's no telling for sure.
His memory could return in days,weeks, years, or never.
Or weeks.
Peter, I want youto meet your family.
You're...my family?
That's right.These are your children.
Dad, I'm Chris. I'm your son.
I've never seen you beforein my life.
Wow, then I must be invisible!
Hey, everybody, I'm invisible!
HERBERT: Oh, no, you're not.Hot diggity!
This is Meg, your daughter.
D'oh! No, Peter,that's not your catchphrase.
Oh. Sorry, I justdon't remember anything.
Dad, this is your baby and your dog.
Oh, he doesn't remember us.
It's an opportunityto come up with our own names.
I'm Tomax and this is Xamot.We're twins who can feeleach other's pain.
Ow! No, Brian,I'm supposed to say, "Ow!"
You ruin everything!
Ow.
All right, Peter,we're gonna try to jog your memory
with some old videotapesof the family.
Boy, you got a lot of tapes here.I wanna watch some of these instead.
Pretty Woman? What's that?It's just a movie from the '80s.
Oh, my God, we've gotta watch this.Look what they're saying about it.
"As funny as it is touching.Gene Shalit."
"I stood up and cheered,"Go, Julia, go!" Joel Siegel."
"This movie made me laugh so hardI had mild headaches
so I went to the doctorand got myself checked out.
I'm currently awaiting results.Gene Siskel."
Everyone seems to love this.We've gotta watch it!
We'll watch it later, Peter.
I wanna show you one of the mostspecial times of your life and mine.
Our honeymoon.
I think you've had enough, Peter.
DRUNKENLY: You don't know. Get away!
I know my body better than you!
Is that...us?Yes, Peter.
You were so handsomeand it was such a wonderful week.
Hey, buddy,I think that girl likes me.
Of course she does. She's your wife.
Do you like her?(GIGGLES) I don't know...
(GIGGLES)
(SIGHS) You know, this isn'tgonna be easy, you guys.
We're gonna have to re-teach yourfather everything he's forgotten.
Hey, have you heard thisawesome new song? No!
# Well-a bird, bird, bird
# B-bird's the word# Well-a bird, bird, bird
# B-bird's the word# Well-a #
This is called a telephone, Peter.
You use it to talk to peoplewho aren't in the house.
There are others?
Yes, there are over six billionpeople in the world.
Here, I'll show you.We'll call my parents.
(PHONE RINGS)CARTER: Hello?
Hello.Who's this?
Who's this?Carter. Who's this?
I don't know.
Do you have my OxyContin?What?
Are you the guy?I'm a guy.
I want my drugs.What are drugs?
I don't think this is the callI was expecting. (HANGS UP)
Now, Peter, this is your silverware.
You see, this is your forkand this is a knife.
CROCODILE DUNDEE:That's not a knife. That's a knife.
This is also a knife.
Oh. Well, I'll be on my way.
I wanna see more of himand then suddenly none of him...
forever.
All right, you know what?This is not working.
If you're gonna learn to drive,you're gonna have to practice first.
Here. Play Grand Theft Autofor eight hours
and then we'll give it another try.
So, you guys are my best friendsand this is where we hang out?
That's right.I'm Quagmire and this is Joe.
So, what do we do here?Well, we usually come here,
you buy us drinks and tell uswhat Lois' nipples look like,
like you always do.Giggity-giggity.
Yeah, but first you usuallygo over there
and pull down thatblonde waitress' top.
(WAITRESS SCREAMS)(SLAPS)
She screamed so I had to slap her.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Get nude. Get nude. Please get nude.Please get nude.
Peter, you don't have to spy on me.
You're my husband. Come on in.
Oh, boy, no fooling? Oh, boy!
Wait a minute.Something's happening in my pants.
In the front this time.That's all right, Peter.
It just means you're excited.
That's the way it's supposed to bebetween a husband and wife.
It means you wanna make love.
But...I forget how to make love.
Shhhh. Shh-shhh. That's OK.
I'll show you. Just follow my lead.
# It feels like the first time
# Feels like the very first time
(BOTH MOANING)
Wow! That was what they call sex?
Yes, it was, Peter.
Can we do it again?Huh? Huh? Can we?!
Wow! You're as excited as aporcupine meeting a pineapple.
Hey, good-looking.Where have you been all my life?
(CHUCKLES)
Morning, nice peoplewho I still don't know your names
and who mean nothing to me.
Well, I certainly hopethat doesn't apply to me.
Especially after last night.You've got a point there, hot stuff.
And if sex with the rest of youis half as good as it was with her,
then I think we're all gonnaget along just fine.
Yay!What? No. No, Peter.
You can't have sex with the kids.
I wish you'd told him thatbefore he lost his memory.
(ALL GASP)It was a joke!
I was just making a joke.That's your sense of humour?
I was just kidding. God!
Meg, that's awful.
Jeez, you open your mouthfor a joke once
and that's what you come up with?That's messed up, Meg.
I was just trying to be funny. Thatwasn't funny. That was just dark.
Yeah, that's your father. Get out,Meg! Get out of the kitchen!
Go on! Get out! Out! Out! Out!
Out of the kitchen!Go on! Get out of here!
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, Peter, there you are.I've been waiting.
You ready to have sex?You bet.
Move over so Tiffani and Ihave room.
What?! Who the hell is she?!
She's the woman I'm gonna havesex with tonight.
Don't worry about getting mepregnant. I'm already pregnant.
Peter, what's the matter with you?
You can't just have sex with somerandom woman! Why the hell not?
Because we're married!Well, I'm sorry
but I don't remember marryinganybody.
Why the hell would I committo having sex with one person
for the rest of my life?Because we love each other!
That's part of being a family.
It means being responsibleand faithful.
Well, that doesn't sound very fun.
Well, if that's how you feel,then we no longer have a family.
Boy, I'm glad you said it.
But this is my houseand I'm not going anywhere.
You don't have to. I'm leavingand I'm taking the kids with me.
That's a beautiful necklaceyou're wearing, Tiffani. Thank you.
Is that what you do with yourSaved by the Bell money?
Mom, I don't wanna livein a tiny, gross apartment.
Well, I'm sorry, honey,but we don't have a choice.
Your father doesn't rememberhis life
and he doesn't want usto be a part of it
so we've just gotta move on.
Oh, this is disgusting.I shouldn't be here.
A baby doesn't belongin the inner city
any more than a babybelongs on a plane.
(BABY CRIES) Shhh.It's gonna be OK. Gonna be OK.
STEWARDESS: Our in-flight moviethis evening is Hancock.
(BOTH WAIL)
Peter, what the hell is all this?
Well, I'm a bachelorso I invited a bunch of people over
and now I'm waiting for themto leave. That's what bachelors do.
I'm interested in the redhead withthe wooden arms and legs over there.
You think you could introduce me?That's a table, Seamus.
Don't point. She's looking.Oh, great. Now I gotta go in.
Hey, I'm Seamus. Peter,you left your family for this?
Look, I don't knowwhat I was doing before
but this is the wayman was meant to live.
I just know it. Check it out.
Don't you miss your family?What? That lady and those kids?
I don't even remember them.How could I miss them?
I almost don't wanna ask you outbecause I know you're gonna say no.
You wanna go out? No? OK.
Giggity.
Giggity.
Gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig
gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig
gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig-gig
gig-gig-gig-gig-gig. Giggity!
Lois! Oh, my gosh! Hi!
Oh, hi, Quagmire. What a surprise.
I know, right? Gosh, you know, Iwas just picking up a couple of hams
to take down to the shelterand here I run into you
buying food to make dinnerfor your husband.
No, actually, Glenn,maybe you haven't heard but uh...
Peter and I aren'ttogether any more. What? Why?
Oh, it's a long story.You don't wanna hear about it.
Oh, shut your face (!)I wanna hear all about it.
But listen,I've got all this shopping to do
so you want to stop bytomorrow night?
I'll just whip something up.Well, sure.
You know, that sounds nice, Glenn.
Holy smokes, this is a sure thing.
Like the end of a Mexican wedding.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Aw, crap, we're out of milk.
I'm gonna run next doorto the airport and get some.
Hey, when you're over there,can you get some rodent traps?
We've got a giant mutant ratliving under the sink.
I'm just gonna hide under the sinktill y'all go to sleep
then I'm gonna come outand make my poops in your Kickz.
Hey, Stewie, is Lois back yet?I've been trying to get hold of her.
She went to Quagmire's for dinner.What?!
Ah, that was a delicious dinner,Glenn.
I didn't know you could cook.
Well, when a fella's been aloneas long as I have,
he learns to take care of himself.Well, you're a very sweet friend
and you're so goodto listen to my troubles.
Oh, I could listen for hours, Lois.
Whoo! Boy, you know... I don'tknow how half a glass of wine
got me so light-headed.I better lie down.
You want me to help you upstairs?
Oh, my God, you are a saint!
Oh, I think I can make it from here.
Oh! Whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
(BOTH LAUGH)
Oh, whoops!Professor Klutz, the doctor is in!
(LAUGHS) Oh...where's this heading?
Oh, hiya, Brian.All right, Peter,
now I know your headis still a blank slate
but you've gotta listen to mewhen I say...
Wait. Did you just call me "Brian"?Oh, yeah.
You've got your memory back?Uh-huh.
Happened yesterday on my way backfrom the grocery store.
Hi, Peter.
Hey, you just snubbed mein front of my own house.
I thought we'd cometo an understanding!
Look, fella, I don't knowwho you are and I don't want to
so why don't you just go backto your crabgrass?
This happens to be freshMarathon Sod!
Oh, man, I just got my memory back.
And as I recall,I don't really care for you!
Wait a minute. Who are you?
Hey, I know you!
What's your beef, stranger?Well, if it isn't my old nemesis!
I was just lucky he hadan odd number of objects.
Why the helldidn't you tell anybody?
I figured I could enjoy thebachelor life for a few more days
before getting Lois back.
Well, you may have waitedtoo long already.
Lois is on a date with Quagmireand you've gotta stop her
before something happens.What? Where is she?
She's next door at his house.You better get there quick
because with Quagmire,sex is inevitable.
Like a fat guy ordering dessertwhen everyone else wants to leave.
So, does anyone want dessert?Oh, I couldn't eat another bite.
No, I've gotta get home for thesitter. I'll have the souffle.
That takes 45 minutes.That's OK.
Oh, I can't believe we're doing this
but I've gotta say,it feels kind of right.
I know, it's so weird, right?I mean, it's, like, fast.
I mean, it's fast,but it feels, like, OK...
you know?I mean, like, isn't that crazy?
It's like this adventurethat we're having together.
I know. That's exactly how I feel.
I mean, it's a little strange
but if Peter'snever coming back to me,
it's at least nice to knowI'm in the arms of a trusted friend.
You... You...trust me?
Uh-oh.Is something wrong?
I-I-I don't know.I'll be right back!
(RAPID PUMPING)
Damn it!
Lois!Peter?! What are you doing here?!
I got my memory backand I love you, Lois!
I want you and the kids back.I want our old life back!
Oh! I don't believe it!Sweetheart, it's you!
You're back!Argh! Damn it!
I'm back, Lois, and I'm sorry.
I treated you so badly
but I hope you know it wasonly because I wasn't myself.
I didn't just lose my memory,I lost my mind.
Clear!(ELECTRIFYING SOUNDS)
Damn it!Oh, my God, Peter, I don't care!
I don't care!I'm just overjoyed to have you back!
Let's go home.
Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it! (CRIES)
