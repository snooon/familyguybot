(SINGING) It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex an TV
But where are those
good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do
All the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He's a family guy
All right, ladies,
let's pick teams for dodgeball.
Connie, would you like to be a captain?

Sure. I pick everyone except Meg.
Fair enough. Go!
(WHISTLE BLOWING)
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
(GROANS)
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Hey, where's everybody going?
That's not how we end this class.
Good job today. Good job today.
Great class. Nice hustle.
Hey, how was gym class?
Terrible. You know, I don't think I can take
another semester at this school, Ruth.
It's torture.
It's worse than sitting next to a baby
on an airplane.

So what brings you to Kentucky?
I'm visiting my family.
Ah, family man. Me?
Single and ready to mingle.
Tom Brunell's the name.
Insurance is the game.
And right now,
the game is very good to me.
Hey, I know!
If you hate it so much here,
why don't you come to Paris
for a semester with me instead?
I'm leaving next week.
You're going to Paris for a semester?
Yeah, it's a program sponsored
by the high school.
My aunt even has an apartment there
that we can stay in for free.
Oh, my God, that sounds so amazing!
Excuse me, I was wondering if you
would go to the dance with me on Friday.
Chris, it's me, Meg.
(SIGHS) Well, that's everybody.
MAN ON TV: We now return
to "Ethiopian Hoarders."
(SOBBING) I don't know
how it got like this!
Dad, Mom, there's something
I want to ask you.
Can I go to school in Paris for a semester?
What? Paris?
Hey, you know, I have a pen pal in Paris.
Would you mind bringing him this letter?
(HAWKS)
We're fighting.
Meg, I'd love to send you to Paris
for a semester,
but we can't afford that.
But I can pay for it myself.
I've been saving up
from all my part-time jobs.
That's smart of you, Meg.
You know, sometimes I do part-time jobs
for extra cash.
- (VIOLIN SCREECHING)
- Gimme money. Gimme money.
Gimme money. Gimme money.
You be careful, sweetie,
and call us as soon as the plane lands.
Okay, Mom, I will. I'll miss you, Dad.
(GROANS) l've never been very good
at saying good-bee.
Good-bee, Meg.
And I'm gonna bring you back
something special, little guy.
Don't worry about me.
Just get yourself laid.
Will you get me
French Stewarfs autograph?
Say hello to the Pont Neuf for me,
or as I like to call it, my inspiration point...
Oop. you're gone.
And the family's gone.
Oh, my God, we're actually herein Paris.
This is so exciting!
(FRENCH ACCENT) Good day, foreigners.
On behalf of the country of France,
we surrender.
Oh, my God, I love your breath.
Hi, I'm Meg. This is my friend, Ruth.
Would you ladies like to share a cab,
or as we say,
"share a cab"?
- Sure.
- That sounds great.
Oh, and please do not be suspicious
that I am at the airport
with no baggage whatsoever.
A cool name to say with
a French accent is Ashton Kutcher.
- Bye!
- Thanks!
(DIALING)
Hey, it's me.
I've got some fresh arrivals for you.
How are they? On a scale from un to dix,
they're about a trois.
Wow, this place is awesome!
I know! Hey, you wanna dance around
like morons to loud music?
- (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
- I'll be right back.
I've been holding in a dump since America.
(PHONE RINGING)
Griffin residence.
Hi, Dad, it's me.
Just wanted you to know I got here safe.
- And sound?
- Yes, Dad, and sound.
Oh! Good.
The "sound" is what concerns me.
- Oh, it's so amazing here, Dad.
- Yep.
- You should see it.
- Uh-huh.
- The apartment we're staying in is huge...
- Uh-huh.
- ...and has an incredible view of...
- Uh-huh.
(GASPS) Dad, somethings going on.
Some men just broke in.
(GASPS) Oh, my God! They've got Ruth!
(DOOR KNOB RATTLING)
(GASPS) And now,
I think they're coming after me!
All right, Meg, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.
Panic. Pay no attention to detail.
Let your mind race.
Take short, rapid breaths.
Then hide under the bed,
but leave two of your feet sticking out.
(DOOR OPENING)
(WHISPERING) Oh, my God, Dad!
Are they gonna take me? I'm so scared!
(SCREAMING)
Meg? Meg?
(MAN BREATHING HEAVILY)
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want.
But I have a very particular lack of skills.
I will never be able to find you,
but what I do have is $2
and a Casio wristwatch.
You can have one of them.
MAN ON PHONE: Drakkar Noir.
(LINE CLICKS)
These guys are serious.
Lois, Meg's dead!
Please, there's gotta be something
you can do!
My little girl is in terrible danger!
Ma'am,the men
who took your daughter are most likely
members ofa sophisticated network
of human smugglers.
If she's not found within 96 hours,
chances are she's gone forever.
Then we've gotta hurry!
Sorry, we can't begin our search
until she's been missing for 96 hours.
Oh, my God! My baby!
Yeah, there's a pretty grisly
sex trade over there.
Usually we just end up burying
framed pictures.
Oh, Peter! This is a nightmare!
(SOBBING)
What's going on down there?
Are they gonna find her?
Doesn't look good.
Stewie, I think there's only one way
we're ever gonna see Meg again.
You and I have to take matters
into our own hands.
What? What are you talking about?
Look, you're the only one
who's got the know-how
and the technology
to help us track her down.
Hmm. Interesting.
Last week, all my gadgets were "hooey,"
I think was the word.
- I didn't say...
- You said "hooey"!
All right, I've booked us on a flight
that leaves in two hours.
So, um, whose credit card
shall we put it on?
Just put it on yours and l'll pay you back.
Yeah, I feel like when that happens,
I sometimes don't get paid back.
Like when?
Jersey Bays,
Morton's Steakhouse, Foxwoods...
Foxwoods and Jersey Boys
was the same trip!
(SIGHS) You know what? Fine.
I'll put it on my card,
but l'm just gonna say it's a gift
because that's the only way
I can do this anymore.
All right, the first thing we've got to do
when we land
is check the apartment
where Meg was abducted
and see if we can find some clues.
That sounds good.
That's what I was thinking.
Excuse me, do you mind if we switch seats
so my family can sit all together?
No, we don't... We don't switch.
'Cause when we booked,
they didn't have three together.
Ma'am, ma'am, your poor planning
does not constitute an emergency for me.
You'll see him in Paris. Go sit down.
God, Meg's kidnappers could be anywhere
in France by now.
Well, we do have one lead, Brian.
I have a recording of the kidnappefs voice.
What? You do? How?
I recorded the kidnappefs phone call
with the fat man.
You see, Brian, I record all phone calls
coming in or out of the house.
- (STAMMERS) You do?
- Yep.
This one's one of my faves.
WOMAN: Hello, Fundamental Industries.
Haw can lhelp you?
BRIAN: (NERVOUSLY)
Yeah, um, is this Bang Brothers?
WOMAN: Yes.
BRIAN: Oh, okay.
I 'd like to cancel my subscription.
- What's your name?
- Brian Griffin.
- And which site did you belong to?
- Uh, Captain Stabbin '.
WOMAN: And how are you spelling that?
BRIAN: Uh, "Captain", full word,
then "Stabbin',"
S-T-A-B-B-I-N apostrophe.
WOMAN: Okay, I'm checking.
BRIAN: You know,
instead of a "G" at the end.
WOMAN: I'm sorry, sir. I'm not finding
that site. What was the subject matter?
BRIAN: Um, a guy doing chicks an a boat
in a, uh, captain's hat.
WOMAN: Okay, I'm checking.
BRIAN: The, um... (CLEARS THROAT)
The passengers had just signed up
for a tour of the harbor
and then all that stuff happened.
Okay, you made your point.
Well, this is where Meg was staying.
Oh. I thought Paris would be
a bit more picturesque.
Instead it's just traffic and some big guy
using a jackhammer.
But monsieur, this is not a jackhammer.
It is a Jacqueshammer.
(DRILLING IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Oh, God, it's worse than I imagined.
You know, maybe it'd help if we just
tried to track Meg's movements
from the moment she arrived in France.
That's a good idea, Brian.
Let's try Google Earth.
Worth a shot.
There. Enhance.
Wow, I never knew
you could do this on a computer.
'Course not, you spend all your time
on this watching Captain Stabbin'.
All right, we've got to find this man.
Let's see, this was taken at the airport.
He could be some sort of lookout
who spots girls fresh off the plane.
Yes, you're probably right, Brian.
Such scum.
I'll bet they target young girls
the way Army commercials
target minorities.
Hey, other black guys. It ain't so bad.
Oh, my God, Stewie! There he is!
Hey, buddy, we've got a few
questions for you!
Excuse me,
but this is a "smoking only" area.
Oh, sorry. Do you have a, uh...
You know, I really only smoke when I drink.
Oh! Well, this is nice.
This is a nice way to do this.
Look, we need to know,
have you seen this girl?
Quick! He's getting away!
No, he's one of those parkour,
free-running guys.
We'll never catch him!
(GRUNTING)
(BUS HORN BLARING)
(BOTH GASPING)
Oh, no. I have chateau'ed myself. (GROANS)
Damn it.
He died before he could tell us anything.
Brian, he's the first guy.
The first guy always dies.
Well, l'm sure he didn't work alone.
Maybe there's something in here
we can use.
(SCOFFS) This guy has a Velcro wallet.
Grow up.
All right, this is the address
that was in his wallet.
Yeah, but how are we gonna know for sure
if these are the guys who took Meg?
Well, we have the kidnapper's voice
on tape, remember?
MAN: Drakkar Noir.
I can use the voice recognition software
in this recorder to confirm a match.
Now, here. Take this briefcase.
We're Eastern European cologne salesmen.
We ask them what they want,
and when they say Drakkar Noir,
which they all will,
we'll know if we have our man.
(BELL BUZZING)
MAN: Drakkar Noir?
(BEEPS)
All right, well, that's not him,
but this is gonna be easy.
Well, gentlemen, now that you have
smelled all of our colognes, what'll it be?
I will take some Drakkar Noir.
(BEEPS)
How about you?
I am disgusting,
so I will take two bottle Drakkar Noir.
(BEEPS)
- How about you, chief?
- Hmm.
Let me quickly grow beard
and think about it.
I will take Drakkar Noir.
(WARBLES)
(GUN SHOTS)
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTING)
What the hell are you doing?
We haven't eaten since the plane.
I'm starving.
Where is this girl? Where is she?
We keep girls upstairs.
I hope you burn in hell
along with the guy who came up
with stuffing a turkey.
Hey! Who wants to try
some of my butthole bread?
Meg? Meg?
(WEAKLY) Help me.
Oh, we're here to help somebody else,
sweetheart.
Go, go, go, go. Don't look at her.
Don't look at her. That was my mistake.
- Stewie, I don't see Meg anywhere.
- Brian, look!
(SOBBING)
Oh, my God! Meg!
- What the hell?
- Where'd you get that hat?
A girl gave it to me.
What did she look like?
- She had a great personality.
- That's her.
Where is she? ls she here?
No, they took her just a little while ago.
Every Wednesday night,
they auction some of the girls off.
Wednesday? What a weird night
to auction girls off into slavery.
Well, you know, on the weekend,
people probably have plans.
Have plans? What are you doing that's
more important than buying somebody?
Look, where is this place?
Where do they have the auction?
I don't know, but there is a courtesy
shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
What?
Damn it. We just missed it.
What do you wanna do for 20 minutes?
Well, I don't know about you,
but l'm gonna work out.
That's how you stay in shape.
You just fit it in when you have free time
wherever you are, wherever you can.
There's semen on this floor.
Stewie, look!
We gotta get in there!
- Hey, got one more here!
- (IN GIRL'S VOICE) Oh! Where are we?
I'm from Atlanta.
I don't know where we are!
Hey, you better hurry.
They're starting soon.
You know what's messed up?
This is all for charity.
All the proceeds are going to Oxfam.
I hope we're not too late.
You should not be out here.
Bidding is about to start.
- What the hell?
- Stewie!
WOMAN: (FOREIGN ACCENT)
The current bid is $200,000.
Oh, my God.
WOMAN: Going once, twice...
Sold for $200,000.
Remember, there is cash back
when you use your Visa Gold.
Our next item appears to be a late entry.
It is not in the catalog.
What the hell?
All right, fellas, bring the lights up a bit,
play the CD I gave you and let's do this!
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Ah, that's right. You like that?
- (CHIMING)
- WOMAN: I have $50,000.
- (CHIMING)
- I have $75,000.
Thank you, Brett Ratner.
Do I have $100,000?
For God's sake. $500,000.
WOMAN: We have $500,000.
Going once, going twice...
Sold to the man
who doesn't quite get auctions.
That was so fun.
How do you be paying?
Oh, I don't have any money.
Can we work it out,
maybe some other way?
Wait a minute.
Something doesn't smell funny here.
You're not Arab!
You two are coming with me.
WOMAN: This next girl is perfect for those
ofyou who want to buy a sex sla ve
but don't want to spend sex-slave money.
Oh, my God, Meg!
Wonder what music
they're gonna use for her?
(FAIL MUSIC PLAYING)
(GRUNTS) Seems about right.
Damn it. We were so close to saving Meg.
Hey, where's my sister?
She's probably having
her shish kabobbed as we speak.
I heard that from Samantha
in Sex and the City 2.
(GIBBERING LOUDLY) I haven't seen it yet.
That doesn't hurt the story.
And now prepare to...
(GROANS)
We have a jail cell.
I always tell them,
"Put the prisoners in the jail cell."
But they always say,
"Just chain 'em up to a pipe."
Idiots.
Hey, that was some good teamwork, Brian.
We were like Lewis and Clark
and the guy who likes to tip over canoes.
(GRUNTS) These rapids are treacherous.
We should reach calmer waters by nightfall.
Uh-oh, earthquake!
- Hey, come on!
- Careful!
- Damn it. Why is he still with us?
- I know!
Until now, walking to the other end
of the United States
seemed like such a good job.
(ENGINE STARTING)
There she is! Hurry!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Stewie, what are you doing?
We'll never catch a speeding car on foot.
Haven't you ever seen an action movie?
All we have to do is cut diagonally
across any nearby field.
(BRAKES SQUEALING)
See?
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Oh, crap, they're taking her onto that yacht.
(GROANS)
All right, we just gotta catch up
to the boat.
Well, how we gonna do that?
Oh, cool! They got Car Chase GPS.
(BEEPS)
AUTOMATED WOMAN'S VOICE:
Back up dangerously into traffic.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(HORN HONKING)
Proceed wrong way down busy street
for 500 meters.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(HORN HONKING)
Say "hang on "and drive down staircase.
Hang on!
Poorly edited shot
where driver is obviously stunt person.
Leave fart in closed car like a dick.
BRIAN: Sorry about that!
All right, they're probably holding her
below deck.
You take the right side. I'll take the left.
You're gonna need this.
What? I've never killed anybody before.
Relax, they're Arabs.
People will still be rooting for you.
Hey!
(SIGHS) Son of a bitch.
Oh! This is like a video game.
Huh! I'm kind of good at this.
(GROANS)
Later, dink!
(GUN CLICKING EMPTY)
(GROWLING)
(GUNSHOT)
That's for shooting one of our guys!
(ALL CHEERING)
MAN 1: We got you!
MAN 2: In your face!
MAN 3: Our boat!
MAN 4: Our boat!
MAN 5: This boat!
There wasn't one guy my way.
Let me go, you fat bastard!
I will never be your sex slave!
You misunderstand.
I did not buy you to be my slave.
I bought you for my son,
and not to be his slave,
but to be his wife.
- Wife?
- Faisal!
This is Faisal, my son
and the heir to my throne.
My father was correct.
Your beauty knows no bounds.
Fair goddess, it is my hope
that you will agree to be my wife,
but the choice is yours.
If you say "no,"
I will have you flown back to your family
on our private jet.
But if you say "yes,"
I will spend the rest of my days
making your every wish come true.
Will you be my wife, Princess Meg?
Oh, yes! Yes!
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
(GUNSHOT)
No!
- Stewie?
- (INNOCENTLY) Hi, Meg.
(ZAPPING)
Oh, honey, we are so glad to have you back,
but you really don't remember anything?
Not really, Mom.
I mean, one minute, I was being
proposed to by a handsome Arabian prince,
and the next thing I know,
l'm waking up in a French hospital.
Oh, and we heard from Ruth's parents.
She had her tongue ripped out.
(CHUCKLES) I guess we got off easy, huh?
Well, we put all your mail
on the desk in your room, sweetheart.
Thanks, Dad.
I'm kidding. You didn't get any mail.
</div>\t'
