&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
TV ANNOUNCER:We now return to Wes Anderson's
Pan Up, Pan Down,French Song, The End.
FRANCE GALL:&#9834; Viens, suis-moi &#9834;
&#9834; Je connais une route... &#9834;
Wow, that was amazing, I think!
All right, everyone,
it's time to open upour bank statements.
Let's gather'round for prayer.
Hey, God, it's the Griffins.
Again, we're very sorry
we cyber-bulliedthat girl to death.
But we still want a snowmobile.
Today, though,please let there be money
in our bank account.
Amen.Amen.Amen.Amen.
Damn it.It didn't work.
We're still poor.
Peter, every month our savingsget smaller and smaller.
We really gottafigure out a better way
to budget for thisfamily's future.
Bitcoin.
What?I don't know.
This is serious.
We need to thinkabout our kids' education.
Of course, it's already too latefor Meg to go to college.
And Chris is too dumbto get in anywhere.
Yay!
No, Chris.Not yay.
But there's stilltime for Stewie.
Let's sit down laterand see if we can figure out
a plan to get ourfinances in order.
Eh, don't worryabout it, Lois.
I will always providefor the family.
Even if I have toshoot our dinner.
(screaming)
(gunshot)
This will look greatin my study.
I'm a hunter,
but I'm a silly hunter.
(clears throat)
(swallows thickly)
Hey, don't fill up on that.
We got breakfast coming.
Hey, Peter, I thinkI figured out one way
we can save moneyfor Stewie's college.
If we bundle our cableand Internet together,
we can save$14 a month.
No! Bundling isa sign of defeat!
Plus, I figured outsomething better.
A metal detector.What?
Yeah, it combines two ofAmerica's greatest resources:
garbage and luck.
That's stupid,Peter.
Ah, you're justsaying that
because the battery it usescauses bladder cancer.
Well, then, I'm off.
I shall be at the beachlooking for valuables
and occasionally usinga doorless bathroom.
Good day, madam.
TV ANNOUNCER:We now return toThe Awkward Stepdad Show.
Man, your mom'sa real groaner.
Do you hear thatin your room?
Hey, Dad,where are you going?
Well, Meg, now thatI'm a metal detector guy,
I gotta start eating breakfastat on-the-sand caf&#233;s,
where I willjudge tourists
as my skin brownsand hardens.
Stop throwing your kid's diapers
in the trashwith all the soda cans!
Hey, Lois, check out whatI found with my metal detector.
Are those... arethose Purple Hearts?
Yeah, some idiot buried,like, a hundred of 'em
in this big lawnunder these bone cages.
Peter!
I think you desecrateda military graveyard!
Hey, guys, like four jeeps
just drove uponto our front yard.
They must be herefor the medals!
Maybe. Or it could bebecause of my
"I'm Gonna Barfon the White House" blog.
(metal detector beeping)
(beeping increases)
Ah, sweet!
Huh.
Wonder what happens if I turn iton and point 'em at each other.
Oh, my God!
Did you also callinto a talk show
without turning downyour radio first?
(beeping)
(beeping increases)
Jackpot.
Wow, an iPad!
This thing findseverything!
(beeps)Engagement ring!
(beeps)Family locket!
(beeps)Sunglasses that are an upgrade
over my current pair!MAN:There he is!
There's the guy who's beenstealing everyone's stuff!
Don't yell at me,I'm very sunburned!
(clattering)Go, crappy car, go!
Peter, did you roba bunch of people
on the beachwith your metal detector?
Well, that's onlyhalf the story.
I also hooted at a ladywho was breastfeeding.
I want you to get ridof that metal detector.
All you're doing isgetting into trouble
and digging up junkwhen we really need
to be savingfor Stewie's college.
Tomorrow we aregoing to the mall
and returning thatthing to the store.
(sighs)Okay, fine.
But you should know, the dayI bought this metal detector
was the happiestday of my life.
Well, obviously,the second happiest.
&#9834; Now we gonna do this thinga little different tonight &#9834;
&#9834; You gonna come over,pick me up in your ride &#9834;
Oh, my God, I wasn't evensupposed to be here.
I passed out at the Tom Pettyconcert last night
and just stayed.
&#9834; You're gonna open my door &#9834;
&#9834; And I'm gonna reach overand open yours &#9834;
&#9834; Gonna pay for dinner,take me to see a movie &#9834;
&#9834; And whisper in my ear how badyou really want to do me... &#9834;
Please, go slow.
I have IBS.
Well, I'm gladthe store was willing
to take thatmetal detector back.
All right, let's goto the food court.
I love eatingPanda Express
while squeezin' our purchasesbetween our knees
'cause someonemight grab 'em.
God, the mall sucks,doesn't it, kids?
If I had a credit card,I'd shop online.
Oh, hey, Bonnie.
What are you guysdoing here?
Oh, hey, Lois.
We saw an adlooking for a toddler
to appear in a peanutbutter commercial
and we thoughtwe'd bring Susie.
Joe, are you wearinga corsage?Yeah.
You can get a really good dealon them after prom season.
They're for girls, Joe.
Hey, Peter,
why don't you let me do me,and you do you, okay?
Peanut butter commercial, huh?
Hey, Bri, maybeyou should audition.
You know, because of thatone time you got in the trash
and ate a whole jar ofrecalled peanut butter?
It wasn't peanut butter.
It was that pre-mixed peanutbutter and jelly thing.
Oh, Mom bought that?
That's what the scab kidat school always has!
That was really great, Jake.
Really, really great.
Your face is upside-down,
so we're not gonna pick you,but thanks for coming.
Hey. Hey.This is you.
"I'm Brian.
"I like garbagepeanut butter,
and I wear my 'I Voted' stickerfor a week and a half."
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
(laughs)
I'm sorry, we're looking for
more of a"Num-num-num-num-num-num-num."
Bob, look over there!
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
Whose kid is that?
Oh, that's our son, Stewie.
He's adorable!
And exactly whatwe're looking for!
Congratulations, your sonis the new peanut butter kid!
My God, I don't believe it!
That's so cool!
Hey, what's Dad doingover there with Chris?
Oh, he's telling him that he'sno longer his favorite son.
(no audio)
No!
(sobbing):No, Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy...
(grunting)
I didn't even tell him.
He just does notlike to be touched.
Thanks for comingto the viewing party
for Stewie's commercial,everybody.
We're sorry that it's airingduring 2 Broke Girls,
but we have nocontrol over that.
Thanks for coming tomy big night, Brian.
I see you got all dressed upin your exposed wiener.
Quiet, everybody!Here it comes!
(upbeat music plays)
Welcome home, honey!
There's my family!
H-Hey, wait,where's the baby?
Well, he likeshis hero dad,
but he lovesScooter's Peanut Butter.
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num!
ANNOUNCER:Scooter's Peanut Butter.
So good, your babywill want to eat it
in an airport terminalbathroom.
(cheering, excited chattering)
(laughs): He's a babywho did a baby thing.
Let's all calm downa little.
Wow, I can't believeStewie's a commercial star.
We haven't had acelebrity in the family
since my great-aunt,Queen of Burlesque Griffin.
("The Stripper"by David Rose plays)
&#9834; Cheesy jokes &#9834;
&#9834; And ugly broads &#9834;
&#9834; Way back when &#9834;
&#9834; They had no porn &#9834;
&#9834; Just scarves &#9834;
&#9834; Fans &#9834;
&#9834; Fat &#9834;
&#9834; Gross &#9834;
&#9834; A terrible time &#9834;
&#9834; For your penis to live in. &#9834;
Bill. Bill. Bill.
Weird magazine aboutour town that's just ads.
Hmm, this one's for Stewie.
Whoa, a check for $2,000?
Let me see that.
It's a royalty checkfrom Stewie's commercial.
Apparently, he gets paidevery time it airs.
This is great.
We can put it right intoStewie's college fund.
Yeah, yeah,but, you know,
maybe we should keepa little bit out to celebrate.
I mean, I ain'tdone nothin' fancy
since I boughtthose rich guy socks.
Ah, there.
I'm ready to get caughtcheating with my secretary.
&#9834; &#9834;
Welcome, folks.
Would you like flator sparkling water to start?
Garden hosewill be fine.
We prefer it to be hotand then metal-y.
Actually, Peter,
let's go for thesparkling water.
I mean, we arecelebrating
our little commercialstar and his big payday.
Oh, I don't careabout that, ma'am.
You know, this isa nice dinner and all,
but I thought you guyswere going to save
this commercial moneyfor Stewie's college fund.
We are saving it, Brian.
This is justa little celebration.
The rest of it is goingright in the bank.
Yeah, and besides,it's been a while
since we ate at a placewhere if you ask for ketchup,
they look at youlike you're dirt.
You know, Stewieactually got a call
for anothercommercial tomorrow.
Who knows?
This could be the beginningof a nice career for him.
You sure about this, Lois?
I mean... I mean,the world of child acting
can be a pretty badenvironment for a kid.
Maybe we should justlet Stewie's childhood
be about being a child.
Wasn't your kid an actor,you jagoff?
Didn't your fatherhate your guts and die?
Whoa!
Bring a gun to a knife fight.
Look, I-I'm sorry,I'm sorry.
All I'm saying is,
just try to keep Stewie'sbest interests in mind.
Relax, Brian.
Stewie's fine.I mean, look at him.
He's happier thana sunny-side-up egg.
What a great wayto start the day.
What a pan, what a grill.
Oh, no, I'm at Denny's.
MAN: Hey, I'm a drug addictand it's midnight--
where's my breakfast?!
Help, he's onlygonna eat the toast
and put a cigarette out on me.
Okay, Stewie, you bookedthe last commercial
without even trying, so thisone should be a piece of cake.
(low chatter)
Oh, I guess there are otherpeople auditioning, too.
Oh, is your child up for thecough syrup commercial, too?
You'd have no wayof knowing this,
but the moms tendto dress up.
Oh, thank you.
And you'd haveno way of knowing
that my son is theScooter's Peanut Butter Kid.
(chuckles):That's cute.
My son had a gun waved inhis face in a Dexter episode.
Are you guys talkingabout your kids?
My daughter is theAmerican Apparel slut baby.
My son got crapped onin the last Jackass movie.
God, everyone hereis so talented.
Hi, everybody, we'rea little crunched for time,
so we're gonna haveto audition people
right here in the hallway.
You, do somethingexceptional.
Uh, okay.
(cracking)
Ow! Ow.
Oh, my grundle.
It's bruised.
It's bruised bad.
Oh, okay, I'm out, I'm out.
Tappin' out.
Well, that wasa disaster.
It was humiliatingis what it was.
That woman just smiled
when Stewie bangedhis balls on the floor.
A damn disaster.
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num?
Shut up,that's over!
Did you see those other kids?
They were amazing.
One of them was texting
with the funny-dumb kidfrom Modern Family.
I want to text with that kid.
Holy Christmas, there werea lot of hot moms
in yoga pants in there, though.
Dear me, they're reallydisappointed in me, Rupert.
I haven't seenthe fat man this upset
since he wentto the 9/11 museum.
Lois made us do this,
but I wanted to go to theCentral Park merry-go-round.
We had time to do both!
(piano playsBent Fabric's "Alley Cat")
What the hell?
&#9834; &#9834;
(song ends)
Okay, that's great, that'sgreat, that's great.
Just one question,Stewie--
do you get pleasure out ofhumiliating your family?
Yeah, is there some kindof sick joy in it?
Why can't he justbe Pierce Brosnan?
Pierce Brosnanwould've got this.
In a heartbeat!
It's 3:00in the morning.
What the hellare you guys doing?
What does it look like?We're practicing.
Stewie has anotheraudition tomorrow,
and we're not gonna beembarrassed like we were today.
See, this is the kindof thing I was talking about.
And look at him,he can barely stand up.
That's why I made this--I call it "8 Hour Energy."
It's one part 5-Hour Energy,and the other three hours are
espresso, ScottsTurf Builder,
and a tiny, tiny super-smallamount of cocaine.
Just a little bit.
I can't stress thelittleness of it enough.
(gulps)
Whoa, mama,there's a kick like a mule!
&#9834; Who will buythis wonderful morning &#9834;
&#9834; Such a skyyou never did see. &#9834;
There he is,there's the magic.
Peter, you're givingyour baby drugs
to improvehis acting career?
Oh, he's finewith it.
Stewie, if you'refine with it,
bleed from the nose.
I think that'spretty close.
All right, Stewie, now rememberwhat we practiced last night.
And here's a trickto keep that confidence up.
You go in that room
and imagine everyone in itwants you sexually.
I'm doing it right now,and I feel powerful.
Okay.
And don't forget--if you screw this up,
Mommy's gonna killall of your toys.Okay.
All right, now I'm gonna gopsych out these other kids.
Hey, little guy.
Nervous?
Sure you are.
Here's somethingthat might help you.
(air horn blares)
Hey, little guy.
Stewie Griffin?
Oh, right here.
Peter, heneeds a boost.
Give him some ofthe acting soup.
(gulps)
I want to say curse words!
Okay, Stewie, you're justgonna drink this juice,
then say, "Mmm,"and rub your belly.
Yeah, yeah,you got it.
(gulps)
Yeah! Bye, juice!
That was amazing.
I've got goose bumps.
I want himsexually.
Well, Mom, Dad,
I think we've got ournew orange juice boy.
Does this guy reallythink we're his parents?
Stewie got the part?!
Yes!
That is howyou do it!
Oh, hey, Brian.What's going on?
Where's the fridge?
Oh, we got a new one.
Stewie booked thatorange juice commercial,
so we thought we'd make a fewupgrades around the house.
Yeah, I even bought an awesomevoice-activated 3-D printer.
Why the hell do youneed a 3-D printer?
Print coyote.
(whirring)
(coyote growls)
CHRIS:Hey, what, hey, no, no, no!
Heel, heel, heel!
I can't make himattack you, Brian,
but if I keepprinting them,
eventually one willgo after you.
That money is supposed tobe for Stewie's college.
He's an actor, you idiot--he doesn't need college.
Look, I-I just don't think anyof this is good for Stewie.
It's great for Stewie.
He's becoming a star.
That's right.
Man, this must be what it's liketo be Anne Hathaway's parents.
Oh, that's Anne's car.
Ugh.
Hey, Stewie, canI talk to you?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Mom and Dad just, uh, stucka book on my head and-and left.
Stewie, look at you,you're a wreck.
And for what? So Peter and Loiscan spend the money you earned
on crap theydon't even need?
Uh, I'm not supposedto use my voice
for non-payingstuff, Brian.
This is insane--you've got to stop.
Ugh, stop worrying,I'm fine.
And besides, the fat manknows what he's doing.
No, he doesn't,he's an idiot.
Remember? He couldn'teven figure out
how to use a hotelbusiness center.
So, what businessare you in?
Oh, I'm just here to lookat other people's e-mails
who haven't logged out.And how's business?
Well, I've left some pretty wildreplies on a bunch of Evites.
Look at this-- I'mbringing 53 guests.
You're the coolest guy I've evermet in one of these things.
Oh, hey.
You caught mepigging out.
I'm dipping this celerystalk into some lemon water.
But don't freak out.
I'm just gonna smell it andthen throw it in the trash.
Stewie, this hasgotten out of control.
If you're gonnacontinue on this path,
you need to knowwhat your future holds.
Being a child actoralmost never ends well.
You remember that kidfrom A Christmas Story
who got his tonguestuck to that pole?
Yeah, whateverhappened to him?
I'll tell youwhat happened to him.
He did porn.
Boner from Growing Pains? Dead.
Screech fromSaved by the Bell? Porn.
Corey Haim? Dead.
Dana Plato? Porn, then dead.
Oh, no, this is horrible.
You see, Stewie, there aretons of actors like this.
They all started outjust like you,
but eventuallythey were destroyed
by their parents'greed, drugs
or pervertedHollywood directors.
Oh, like Bryan Singer.
Exactly. The point isit's a dark path.
My God, I had no ideait could be so bad.
Brian, I don't wantto act anymore.
Good. Now we just got to makePeter and Lois understand.
Yes, well, if they wantto make me into a monster
like those people, we'llgive 'em a monster.
Like when Godzillaattacked Haiti.
(flames crackling)
(roars)
Oh, my God.
Peter, did youget my text?
No, hold on.
No, I don't knowwhat he's doing here.
Okay, Stewie, when Barbarahands you that orange juice,
you're gonna drink itand smile.
And really show us thatenergy from your audition.
H-Hold on a second,he's got a smudge on his face.
Let me just take careof that for you guys.
Here, drink this.
I threw a little Mollyin there, too,
so we'll go outclubbing afterwards.
Hey, you want this?
Sure, I'lldrink anything.
All right, action!
As a mom, I want my kidsto start their day right.
And there's no better waythan with a glass
of fresh-squeezedSunnydale Orange Juice.
Isn't that right,sweetie?
Shut your hole, bitch!
I'll tell you what I wantfresh-squeezed-- these.
(shrieks)
What the hell'she doing?
He's blowing this.
Oh, here's what I thinkof this orange juice.
(grunting)
I-I can't... I can't go rightnow with everybody watching.
But-but I presume you understandthe disrespect I intended.
Oh, my God, he'shaving a meltdown.
You don't suppose thishas anything to do
with the sleep deprivationand narcotics?
Oh, Peter, what havewe been thinking?
It's us-- we're the oneswho turned him into this.
Get this kid out of here!He's fired.
Well done.
Not a bad performance.
Thank you, Brian, I...
Uh, there's the poop.
Right now.
Oh, Stewie.
Mommy and Daddy are so sorry.
I-I guess we just gottoo caught up in your success
and forgot that you'rejust a baby.
You wereright, Brian.
I guess we pushed Stewiea little too hard.
Well, the good news isthat now he can go back
to being a regular kid.
&#9834; &#9834;
Why are you winking atour baby, you creep?
God, that's weird.
I don't want to eversee that happen again.
Well, we went a little crazythere, didn't we, Peter?
But I'm glad we have
our normal, very average,non-famous baby back.
You know, I was oncea very famous baby.
Were you, Peter?
No, but you see how easyit is for me to lie to you?
I do it every day.
Anyway, looks like everythingworked out for the best.
You know, Brian, that actingstuff was a bit much for me,
but I did quite enjoythe dancing and the cocaine.
Yeah?Yep.
So you're just gonna be adancer and a drug addict?
For a while. I mightcrash when I'm 18,
but then I'll just turnto the Lord and working out.
I'll-I'll just be a 180-degreedifferent type of insufferable.
I used to need drugsto feel powerful,
but now my power comesfrom my core strength.
And let's look at thatword, "strength."
The "S" standsfor sacrifice.
No gain withoutsacrifice.
The "T," of course, stands forthe sufferings of the cross.
The "R"...You want some cocaine?
Oh, my God, please, yes!That's all I want all the time! </div>\t'
