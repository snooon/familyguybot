Hi, it's me, Peter.Your TV cartoon pal.
You know, Lois has beenbitching lately
that I watch too much TVand don't read enough books.
So I went to the libraryand picked up three books
by the greatest author of the last1,000 years - Stephen King.
And tonight I'd like to share themwith you.
We begin with a little tale calledStand By Me.
About four young boyswho went looking for a dead body
and instead found...themselves.
And also a dead body.
The year was 1955.
And the voice in my head was that ofRichard Dreyfuss.
"I never had friends like the onesI had when I was 12.
There was me, Petey LaChance."
Anyone else fed up with thisoversaturation of media?
Three channels and still nothing on.
"Then there was Joey Duchamp. Thevoice in his head was Roy Scheider."
"How are you, Richard?" "Fine,Roy, how are you?" "Good, good."
"We should grab a drink sometimeand catch up.
Maybe reminisce about Jaws."
"Great, you should give me a callsometime.
My number's 555..."
"Wait, wait, what? 555?""Er...yeah."
"You know what, Richard, if youdon't want to have drinks just say.
You don't have to bea dick about it."
Oh, please, make the voices stop!
"And then there was Quag Chambers,he was the leader of our gang.
He had sex when he was fiveand committed his first rape
when he was 10. Rape, of course,being legal in the 50s."
Ha-ha! Beat those cards, fellas!Ha-ha-ha!
Giggety-giggety 50s giggety!
Hey, you guys!"Finally, there was Cleve Brown.
My pudgy black friend.I can still see him now,
all pudgy and black.
Cleve, please, we're busy lookingat Playboy.
Look at the way these womenstarve themselves.
This one can't be more than180 pounds.
This is way better than Playboy.
Do you guys want to see a dead body?
Cleve, it's 1955,please re-enter the clubhouse
in a more stereotypicallyanimated fashion.
Lord Almighty, I done see mea dead body down by the lake!
Sure enough,I thought I'd go deef and dumb
when I saw me that dead body.
Cleve, calm down,you're not making any sense!
# Every day, it's getting closer... #
"Anything was possibleas we set out that day.
Except contracting AIDS
because AIDS had not yet beeninvented by the government
in an effort to eradicatethe homosexual community."
# Have gun, will travel,reads the card of a man
# A knight without armourin a savage land #
OK, I got another one.
# Show me that smile again# Ooo, show me that smile
# Don't waste another minuteon your crying #
"We decided to cut throughOld Man Pressman's junkyard.
Even though legend had it any kidcaught scaling the fence
ran the risk of being attackedby the old man's dog,
who would charge to the cry ofChopper, sic balls."
I got a bad feeling about this.
Hey, what are you kids doing?!Oh, no, it's him!
That's right. I'm Old Man Pressman.I own the junkyard.
I'm cranky cos all my stuff is junk.Why can't I have nice things?
Chopper, sic 'em! Sic 'em, boy!(BARKING)
(PANICKED CRIES)
Now, he said "Sic 'em, boy."But what I heard was,
"Chopper, talk to disfiguredWorld War Two veterans
who aren't as bitteras they should be."
Glad I could do my part.
I think you may have done too much.
DISC JOCKEY:Hey, how about this brand new thing
called rock and roll?Even though it was just invented,
we already remember it fondly.Here's Little Richard
with Piano Riff Woo.
# Woo
# Woo
# Woo

My ass!
Man, this trip is dangerous.Couldn't we have taken a bus?
(MUFFLED SPEECH) ..black guy.
Uh, guys, any one knowwhen the next train is scheduled?
Don't worry. If a train comes,I'll warn you in slow motion.
(TRAIN CHUGGING)
SLOW MOTION: Traaaaaaaaaaaain!
(TRAIN WHISTLES)
(SCREAMS)
Ah! Ah, my legs!
SLOW MOTION: Another traaaaaaaain!
(SCREAMS) What an odd clusteredtrain schedule!
Hey, sorry you got paralysed, Joey.
Oh, it's all right. Thanks for goingall the way back to the junkyard
to get me this wheelchair.Boy, was Old Man Pressman angry.
Ooooooooo!
Well, there it is.
"None of us could breathe.The twisted and mangled body
we had come to seewas far more disgusting
than any of us could everhave imagined."
He's nasty.
Out of my way,you little pipsqueaks.
I'm taking creditfor finding this body.
(ALL GASP)"It was the meanest guy in town.
Ace and his whole gang.
Beastman, Merman and,for some reason, Norm from Cheers."
Hey, gang. What, are webeating somebody up?
Now, get lost.We'll take it from here.
(GASP) (GUN SHOT)
Kiss my grits,you cheap dime store hood.
This ain't over, LaChance.
I mean, you have a gun right now,
but tomorrow I'll get a gunand come to your house and kill you.
Oh. Yeah, I guess you could do that,huh?
I mean, we live in the same town.
And I can't just be on my guardfor the rest of my life.
Boy, that is a major holein this story. OK, take the body.
"We never forgot thatwonderful summer.
And eventually we all wentour separate ways.
Joey learned to live withoutthe use of his legs
and even went on to createa wheelchair-type rugby game
called Don't Feel Sorry For Us Ball.
Cleve grew up and went on to marryRebecca Romijn.
Actually, I'm not even jokingabout that.
The fat kid from Stand By Meis now married to Rebecca Romijn.
Can you believe that? I swear toGod! Look it up on the Internet.
Doesn't that piss you off?
Quag grew up to become a famousHollywood actor.
Unfortunately, about a week ago,
he took an overdose ofdesigner drugs at the Viper Room.
He died on the curb outside.
And now we're left with a harelippedreminder of what might have been."
(SAD TROMBONE)
Hi. Welcome back from commercials.
Joaquin Phoenix,if you're still watching,
you are a good sport and a trooper.
And you passed our test.And you can be our friend.
And now for a segment we likea little less than the first
and the last. Here's Misery.
Marcia, I've done it. I finishedthe book and Snuggly Jeff is dead
and the readers are just gonnalove it.
Paul, I still wish I couldtalk you out of this.
Snuggly Jeff is the most successfulchildren's book series ever.
Yeah, but I want to get into writingmore serious stuff.
Something where the readerdoesn't have a load in his pantswhile he is looking at it.
Well, we'll talk about itwhen you get back.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: This just in.
The Weather Service has reporteda big snowstorm on its way.
Oh, my God! Stephen King!
(SCREAMS)
Hey, this would make a neat story!
Done.
I'm your number one fan.I'm your number one fan.
I'm your number one fan.
(WAKING GROAN) Who...who are you?
I'm Stewie Wilkes. I saved your life.
You were in a terrible car accident.You broke both your legs.
(LIPS SMACK) I taste lipstick.Am I wearing lipstick?
Not any more.
Paul, quick question,and feel free to say no.
But I couldn't help but notice
the new Snuggly Jeff manuscriptin your bag.
And I was wondering if I couldread it, then kill you if I hate it?
Well, I guess that'd be OK.Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Can I read it while I touch your earand suck my thumb? Uh, I guess.
Oh, goody, goody!
(SUCKING AND CHUCKLING)
(DOOR SLAMS OPEN)
Stewie? I just finished the book,you dirty birdie.
How could you? He can't be dead.Snuggly Jeff cannot be dead!
(YELLS) Look, Stewie, I've goneas far as I can with Snuggly Jeff.
And I want to write somethingmore serious.
Well, you are gonna write SnugglyJeff back to life, Mister Man.
Look, Stewie, first of all,you're insane.
And second of all, I have to beinspired before I write.
Well, how about a little TV?
We now return to Magnum. b.m.
Magnum, I found a fingerprint smudgeat the crime scene.
Do you have poo on your hands?
A little.
# THEME SONG FROM MAGNUM P.I
(TYPING)No, no, no, this won't do, Paul.
You can't just have Snuggly Jeffmagically brought back to life
by a child's wish.It's insulting to the reader.
What do you mean?Well, it's just bad storytelling.
Let's see,how can I explain this to you?
Did you ever see the movie Contact?Yeah.
So, they spent $1 trillion buildingthis mile-high space machine.
And Jake Busey blows it up.
So now they're all like, "Oh, no,we can't use the space machine!"
But then this other guy's like,"Hey, it just so happens
I built another identical$1 trillion space machine
at my own expense on the otherside of the world."
And we're supposed to believeno one noticed that?
Well, I stood up in the theatre andI said, "No! You can't go into space
because the machine already gotblown up by Jake-cockadoody-Busey!"
Start over! Fine, but you're gonnahave to go into town
and get me some more paper.I'm all out.
I don't know, Paul. Let me see ifI can get the Big Wheel started.
(IMITATES ENGINE STALLING)Oh, I don't know, Paul.
It's not starting. (IMITATES AGAIN)
Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna flood it.
(IMITATES ENGINE STARTING)
Vroom! Vroom! OK, I got it now.I'll see you in a bit.
(CHUCKLES) He's too bigfor that car.
(FOOTSTEPS) (GASPS)
Mister Sheldon?!Oh, my God, I'm saved!
Let's get out of herebefore Stewie gets back!
(GUN SHOTS) Ah! Ah!
Ah, my legs!
Now I'm gonna have to spendthe rest of my life in a wheelchair!
No, you're not. (GUN SHOT)
Well, that's it, Stewie.The book is done. Can I go now?
Oh, no, Paul. I'm not stupid.
If I let you go, you'll justrun straight to the police
and tell them I kidnapped youand held you hostage
and fondled you while you wereasleep. No, I wo... Wait, what?
You'll tell them that while you weresleeping I did things to you thatyou don't remember.
You fondled me while I was asleep?Yeah.
I don't think I like that.Well, it's done.
# THEME TUNE FROM MAGNUM P.I
Everybody still awake?All right, big finish.
You remember that Stephen Kingstory when the guy went upto the empty hotel
and there were those creepy twinsand the guy was running aroundwith that axe
and the kid talked to his finger?Can't you see Stewie doing that?
Well, here'sThe Shawshank Redemption.
(CHATTER)
(WHISTLING)
The first time I laid eyeson Andy Dufresne,
I didn't think much of him.
He was a fat drink of water,the kind of drink of water
that you know your friend gotfrom the bathroom
and not from the kitchen.
Five packs of cigarettes saysthe fat one breaks first tonight.
You're on. I'll take the Don Martinlooking one.
A month went by before Andy saidtwo words to somebody.
As it turned out,that somebody was me.
Vagina boob.
Later, Andy came backwith more than two words.
I understand you're a manwho knows how to get things.
I've been known to procure variousand sundry items.
I...I don't understandwhat you just said.
I need stuff. Can you get it?What do you need?
I need a rock hammer. What's it for?
I carve Star Wars figurinesout of stone.
But it's also for nottunnelling my way out of here.
Wow, can you carve me a set ofwomen's private part out of stone?
Sure. Or you could just have sexwith Helen Hunt. (LAUGHTER)
Oh, we've only had one conversation,
but I can tell we're gonna belifelong friends.
And since you're black and I'm white,
that makes it more a-specialfor the audience.
Inspection! (BUZZER)
You Andy Dufresne?A little bit. You?
(LAUGHS) I'm just tweaking your bum.What can I do for you?
I understand you make Star Warsfigurines.
Oh, Grievous! Wicked!
Well, anyway,I'm a pretty corrupt guy
so I figured I could sell yourfigurines and pocket the cash.
What do you say? I don't know.
Oh, come on, I'll even cripple thatguy who rapes you in the shower.
But I like that guy. Too late!
(GRUNTING) Ah, my legs!
Two things never happened againafter that.
Bogs never walked again and Andy'sfarts never made a sound again.
(GUST OF WIND)
Thanks to the Star Wars figurinesAndy carved,
he landed a cushy jobcleaning the warden's office.
OK, you clean up the wardens officewhile I go pop out a pinecone.
(FEEDBACK)
# GWEN STEFANI - HOLLABACK GIRL
To this day, I have no ideawhat that woman was singing about.
Like, literally no idea.
I don't know whata hollaback girl is.
But I have to imagine it's a foul,disease-ridden thing
that wears too much make-upto cover up the fact
that it's a 47-year-old fish dog.
Andy, I think you know whyI've called you in here today.
A prison is an environmentwhich requires
the highest level of discipline.
And that little stuntyou pulled today...
(SMASH) That little stuntyou pulled today
made a lot of peoplelook very foolish.
Look, warden,we got it rough in here.
I just thought we could usea little music.
Music is expressly forbiddeninside prison walls!
My God, how can you be so obtuse?
What did you call me?Obtuse. You're being obtuse.
Two months in the hole!Or am I being obtuse?!
No, now you're being acute.
That time in the holechanged old Andy.
I'm getting out of here tonight,Red.
I'm gonna take the poop pipeto the crap swamp.
Wow. Where you headedonce you get out?
Zijuatenejo. Sounds fancy.
Well, actually, it's a filthyMexican village.
Listen, Red,when you get out of here,
I want you to do something for me.
Up in a hay field in Buxton, Maine,under an old oak tree,
there's a rock that has noearthly business being there.
Under that rock is a box withsomething I want you to have.
Of course, now I think about it,I've been in here 25 years.
All these landmarks are based onpossibly outdated observations.
That whole area couldbe a Wal-Mart by now.
If it is, pick yourself up some nicecheap pants and good life to you.
Inspection! (BUZZER)
Dufresne? Dufresne?
Dufresne, you better get your assout here
before you make me cut thissentence shor...
Where is he?Where the hell is Dufresne?!
I don't know, sir.I want him found...now!
Not after breakfast,not after CSI, now!
God, I'm so angryI could just throw a rock
at that poster of David Cassidy.
(ROCK MAKES HOLLOW SOUND)
What the warden and his boys didn'trealise was that Andy Dufresne
had escaped from Shawshank Prisonthe night before.
# FRIENDS THEME TUNE
# So no one told you life wasgonna be this way #
Andy crawled to freedom through500 yards of foulness
I can't even imagine.
Andy Dufresne, the man whocrawled through a river of poop
and came out cleanon the other side.
Why he chose enchilada night,I will never know.
Do you believe,in your best judgement,
that you have been rehabilitated?
Rehabilitated? It's just a stupidmade up word
so boys like youcan sit behind a desk,
wear a fancy suitand feel important.
You're a jerk and I had sexwith your mother last night.
And I swear to God,you let me out of here,
first thing I'm gonna dois kill again.
When I got out of Shawshank,there was only one thing on my mind.
A promise I made to a friendthat I had to keep.
ANDY: "Walk along the stone walluntil you reach the tree.
And that's where you'll findthe rock."
"Dear Red, if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to goa little further.
You remember the name of the townin Mexico, right?"
Crap!
What? Oh, oh, is that him? Is that...No, no, beach dog.
Oh, oh, is that Red?
Is it? No, no, not him either.
Where the hell is that jackoff?
There's like 1200 bucks in that box.
Oh, my God. If he ran off with that.Oh, I am gonna be so pissed.
And what am I gonna do?Go to the authorities?
I just broke out of prison. Now what,I got to spend the rest of mylife here by myself?
Well, at least I won't have to beself-conscious about my farting.
Well, that's our show. Thank you,Stephen King. We'll see you in court.
Now stay tuned for whateverFox is limping to the barn with.
