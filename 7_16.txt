Hey, where's Cleveland?
Doesn't he have a relative in town?I don't know,
but I ordered him a beerand now it's sitting there
looking lonelier thanAlan Rickman's answering machine.
(PHONE RINGING)
(ON ANSWERING MACHINE)"Hello. You've reached Alan Rickman
at 555-0122.
Please leave a message at the beep."
(BEEP)
"Hello, Alan Rickman.It's Alan Rickman
reminding you to move the pork chopsfrom the freezer to the refrigerator
so they defrost properly.Do not disappoint me."
(PHONE RINGING)
"Hello. You've reached Alan Rickman
at 555-0122.
Please leave a message at the beep."(BEEP)
"Alan, it's me again.
Remember that turtle jokefor the party."
(LAUGHS)
Hey, y'all. I want you to meet mycousin from Jamaica, Madame Claude.
Nice to meet you all.(CHUCKLES) You sound like the crabfrom Little Mermaid.
I had crabs once. It's awful.
You gotta buy that cream thatcomes with a little comb.
Of course, I can still use the comb.
Well, that's Quagmire.And you know what else?
Madame Claude is psychic.
She can tell you what you werein a past life.
I already know what I was.A strawberry.
(SIGHS) It's another pleasant dayfor me, Peter the Strawberry.
Hey, Mr Worm.
I welcome your arrival, cos we'reall part of the same garden.
Wait. What are you... Wait, hey.(BLOWING)
Hey, get out of here! Hey!
(SCREAMING)
He was my neighbourand he violated me!
Now I'll never end upin a fancy pie!
What do you say, Joe? You wantyour past life read? It'll be fun.
Sure. Why not?
OK, dear.Close your eyes and clear your mind.
OK. I'm seeing something.Joe, you were an octopus.
Yes! Yes, this is so awesome!
Damn it!
Oh! That's so cool! That's so cool!Do me next.
I'm getting something.I see you in London.
I think it's the 1800s.
Oh, my! You were Jack the Ripper!
(ECHOING FOOTSTEPS)
Giggity...
What about Peter?Yeah, Peter next!
I don't think there's anythingin that black bag for me.
You're wrong, Peter. Let us begin.
Oh, my!You were a very important man.
You were Griffin Peterson,the founder of the city of Quahog.
Now, wait a second, Cool Runnings,
we learned in school that Miles"Chatterbox" Musket founded Quahog
after he was savedby the magic clam.
No, that is a myth. Peter, you werethe founder of Quahog.
I see...I see England a long time ago.
"It is a crisp, clear springmorning,
and Griffin Peterson is ridingto the home of his beloved."
Peterson, what are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be down at your jobmaking oblong bricks out of manureand straw?
No, we're off.It's Martin Luther Day. (CHUCKLES)
Yes, that's a very smart joke.Isn't that right, comedy professors?
(MURMURING IN AGREEMENT)Well done. Indeed.
Now, what do you want?I want to marry your daughter,
and I'm here to askfor your blessing.
What could you possibly haveto offer my daughter?
Well, I'm one of the few guysin this town
who isn't dyinga slow, painful diarrhoea death.
All right, come on in.
Knock-knock. Lady Redbush?
(GASPS) Griffin!It's so good to see you.
I'm so horny. Kiss my hand.What are you doing here?
I was just walking off the rottedgoose anus I had for breakfast,
and I thought I'd come byand ask you a little question.
What's that?Will you marry me?
(GASPS) Oh, my God, yes!
Yes, I will, Griffin!Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
Did you do it?I did it!
(EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY)
"But in another part of London,
there was a manwho was not in such good spirits.
The King of England,Stewart the Third."
(SIGHS) I'm so bored.I wish to be entertained.
Where's my troupe of actors?(FANFARE)
Presenting the cast ofHow I Met Your Mother!
You told her I told youI kissed her?
Dude, you broke the bro code.That's not against the bro code.
Yes, it is. Article 15B. That'sthe heart of the bro code, man.
You're right,I guess I did break the bro code.
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa, whoa, whoa... What is this?
Are these jokes? Do people in othercastles think this is funny?
Well, yeah. We get a pretty sizeablechunk of princes 18 to 34.
I think I'd like to delete thisfrom my TiVo.
Are you sure you wantto delete this program? Yes.
Bring me my mid-season replacementfool!
Hi, there.I want to hear some jokes, fool!
Well, you know,I don't really tell jokes.
I like to tell stories from my life
and let the humour just floworganically from everydaysituations. (CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah, my aunt Friedawas a real card.
She always had the mostwonderful spirit,even when her mind started to go.
I remember once she wrote a letterto my uncle Tom,
from whom she'd been divorcedfor several years.
And in the letter,she misspelled his name 'T-O-M-M'.
And I said, "Frieda,you've spelled Tom's name wrong.
You need to take out one of the'M's." And she said, "Which one?"
You know, you're gonna be(BLEEP) dead in five seconds
if Aunt Frieda doesn't throw a pieat somebody!
Part of that is you sort ofhave to know my - Make me laugh!
Hey, look. Keys.(JINGLING)
(LAUGHS) That's so satirical!What social commentary!
Well, now I'm in a wonderful humour.I wish to go for a walk into town.
Hey, coachman, let's drive onthe left side of the road
and see if that catches on.
Good Lord! Who is that?
That's Lady Redbush and herhusband-to-be, Griffin Peterson.
That piece of ass is marryingthat tall glass of poop juice?
Well, not if I have anything to sayabout it.
A woman of that calibreshould be married to a king.
Well, what are you gonna doabout him? I'm the King, Jester.
I'm going to have him exiled tothe farthest corner of the world.
And then she'll be all mine!
Why is he such a jerk to everybody?
Because he has a very,very small penis.
I've seen it, actually, and youdon't even want to make fun of it.
You know, it's just medicallyfascinating.
I kind of want to see it.Yeah.
It's like that one grape in thebunch that never got to be a grape.
I wonder what's keeping Griffin?I'm sure he'll be along, sweetie.
Remember, he's tubby.It takes him a while to move around.
I hope he didn't get diarrhoea anddie. Can I feel those boobs?
No, Daddy! What are you, sick?Hey, it's a different time!
What a wonderfully exciting day!I'm young, I'm all dressed up,
and I'm on my way to marrythe woman I love.
And there's 290 years separating mefrom the films of Kevin Smith.
KING STEWART: Hey, Peterson.
Who are you?I'm King Stewart.
Don't you recognise mefrom the coins?
Oh, yeah.The ones with your profile.
You know,you look really weird from the side.
That's something we didn't reallythink out too well when we started.
But never mind that!You're going into exile, Peterson!
I'm shipping you out on the firstboat to the New World!
But I'm supposed toget married today. Oh, yeah?
Where are you goingfor your honeymoon?
That medium-sized hill.Wrong! Seize him!
MADAME CLAUDE: "And King Stewart'scruelty was only just beginning."
Maybe he changed his mind.Maybe he's not coming.
Oh! Come on now. There, feel betterafter I just said that?
Now give me one little touch.No!
I hate this! I... I...I hate my life!
(GASPS) The King! The King is here!I didn't vote for him!
Your Majesty, this is a real honour.Carter Redbush.
Very glad to meet you.Hello. Harry MacAfee.
As a citizen, I'm proud to haveyou reign over me
and the MacAfee Fertilizer Company.
Lady Redbush, I wish I was hereon a happier errand,
but I'm afraid I must inform youthat Griffin Peterson is dead.
(GASPS) What?
Now that some time has passed,do you want to go out?
MADAME CLAUDE: "With GriffinPeterson exiled to the New World
and Lady Redbush believinghe was dead,
King Stewart was now freeto marry her."
The bride and groomhave written their own vows.
Our love is like two figshanging from a fig treecradled by Cupid's own hand.
You and I are like two...
Oh, uh...I'm sorry. Is my weddinginterrupting your...your promotion?
We're right in the middleof OUR show, OK?
Right now. You have a time slot.Go there.
Maybe finish this candy barbefore you open another one!
At least it wasn't one ofthose promos
where they've got the whole castshoving each other playfully
like they're all good pals.
Oh, oh, look! There we go!
Oh, look at them jostlingeach other around!
Oh! They give each othera hard time, but they're friends.
Is that a real show?No, it's just... No.
Somebody's making a joke. Forget it.
"Meanwhile, Griffin Petersonand the other exiles
pass the time on the shipto the New World."
Aw, crap! A splinter. Well,it's been nice knowing you guys.
So what'd you do to get exiled?
I got caught pleasuring myself
to a painstakingly etched engravingof the Wife of Bath. What'd you do?
I slept with an underage virginto cure my puff penis.
Hey, fellows. You want to join mein a game of mumble peg?
Oh, no, thanks.Fine. I'll play by myself.
(MUMBLING GIBBERISH)
One, nothing!
"Eventually,after many months at sea,
Griffin Peterson and his shipmatesfinally reached the New World."
I declare this land Quahog!
This place is nothing but awilderness! What are we gonna do?
We're gonna build a new settlement.
We'll have a happy new life,and we'll have equal rights for all.
Except blacks, Asians, Hispanics,Jews, gays, women, Muslims...
Um...everybodywho's not a white man.
And I mean white-white.So no Italians, no Polish.
Just people from Ireland, Englandand Scotland.
But only certain parts of Scotlandand Ireland.
Just full-blooded whites.
No, you know what? Not even whites.Nobody gets any rights.
(SIGHS) America.
How's your stewed fox quail,my dear?
It's quite good.I'm also enjoying the turtled hen.
Isn't the turtled hen good?
So, listen, you and I need to havea conversation
about you not bearing me a son.
Well, my lord, we've discussed this.
We have to have sexin order for me to bear you a son.
Oh, I know. I've just been so tired,and I've had so much work.
And I think think I wanted to theother day but I couldn't find you.
So, you know, it's like, both of usand our schedules, you know?
Well, why don't we do it tonight?
Maybe. Tonight might work. Yeah...
Oh, no! I got that thing in themorning! How about tomorrow at four?
You know I'm with my mothertomorrow at four.
Darn it! I'm gonna be so hornytomorrow at four.
You know, I got to sayI'm a little mad at you
for not being more available. We canhave sex right now on the table.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.We eat here.
"Griffin Petersonand the other colonists
worked day and nightto build their new settlement.
Until finally, after much hard work,the colony of Quahog was complete.
It didn't take long before Quahogwas a thriving New World settlement
bustling with life."
Boy, everything's shaping upreal nice!
Yeah, and we finally finishedthe town abortion clinic.
(COIN CLINKS)
"Time had helpedGriffin forget Lady Redbush.
And soon he found himselfa hearty new wife."
Boy, that was fantastic!You must have had a lot of practice.
No, not really. I've beensaving myself for marriage.
(SIGHS) We should probablyopen up some windows.
I don't know what to do, Jester.
I can't be married to the Kingany more.
My heart still belongs toGriffin Peterson, but he's dead.
(SIGHS)
No, he's not. What?
I was ordered to keep silent bythe King under threat of execution.
But you're gonna see this anyway.
(GASPS) Oh, my God! He's alive.Jester, I've got to get to him.
I'll help you, but only if I can gowith you.
If I stay here, the King willexecute me for telling you all this.
Well, OK,but how are we gonna get there?
We'll hitch a ride on one of theslave ships tomorrow night
after an all-new Shovin' Buddies.
Followed by an all-newSlowly Rotating Black Man.
"And so Lady Redbush sailed off tothe New World to find her beloved,
and the timing was good becausehis new wife was a pain in him ass."
And then I finished scrubbingthe kettle, but then I sawthat I had missed a spot.
And I was so worried thatthe whole thing wasn't clean enough,
so I went backand started washing it again.
And sure enough,I'd missed another spot.
And there was a clump of cornmealunder the rim
from when I made breakfast -Shut up, Meg! I pray thee, shut up.
Griffin!Lady Redbush!
"And so Griffin Peterson andLady Redbush were happily reunited.
Of course, Griffin had to go throughthe complex,
extensive divorce procedurerequired by 18th century society."
Gone? What do you mean, she's gone?
Sire, Lady Redbushhas been gone these six months.
Six months?Yes. Forgive me, sire.
But how could you not be aware ofthis?
Don't you share a bedchamberwith her?
(STUTTERING)Well, I mean, sometimes.
I mean, we sleep...We go to different...
We go to bed at different times.
We've both been so busy,it's been ridiculous.
I thought she was taking a classor something.
Oh, man!That sucks because I'm so horny.
Damn it! Oh...I wanted to do sexto her tonight.
Well, then I guess we've got to goget her. Yeah, all right...
"Months rolled by,
and Griffin and Lady Redbushcontinued to flourish happily
in the colony of Quahog,
completely unaware that King Stewartwas on the march."
# There was a peaceful towncalled Quahog
# Where people lived in harmony
# They never had no kind of trouble
# There was no hint of misery
# Then all at oncethe trouble started

I want you to turn this settlementupside down

No, I wouldn't. Not a corn farthingwould I bet. No, sir.
What's wrong with you?A little wrong in the head, I am,
from eating some bad sausages.
Yes, some bad sausages did I eat,indeed, sir.
Yes, I did. Some bad sausages ate I.
Oh, Griffin, this time together hasbeen the happiest of my life.
Me, too, Lady Redbush.All those months I was without you
I never stopped seeing your facein the back of my wife's head.
And all those monthsI was sailing for the New World,
I saw your face in every slave'sstomach.
Tell me we'll be together forever.We will.
(BOTH GASP)
I found him, Your Majesty.Indeed, yes, I did found him, did I.
Indeed, yes, sir. I did.Yeah, OK, OK. Whatever.
All right, Peterson,two things are gonna happen here.
I'm gonna take my wife back,and then I'm gonna kill you!
All right. All right, Mr King, sir.You win.
I'm sorry, Lady Redbush,but he is your husband.

Wait, wait! There's got to bea better way to settle this!
Talent show?Talent show.
Hear ye. Hear ye.This talent competition
will decide rightful possessionof the good Lady Redbush
and control of the colony ofQuahog.
We first present King Stewart ofEngland

Hi, there, everybody. You know,my aunt Frieda was a real card.
She always had the most wonderfulspirit,
even when her mind started to go.What the (BLEEP)?
I remember once she wrote a letterto my uncle Tom,
from whom she'd been divorcedfor several years.
And in the letter,she misspelled his name 'T-O-M-M'.
This is my bit.These are all my bits.
Sh, this is funny.Unbelievable.
And I said, "Frieda,you've spelled Tom's name wrong.
"You need to take out one of the'M's." And she said, "Which one?"
(LAUGHTER)
