&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;

Although...I mean, one of us
should probablywarn everyone.
You know... that theBritish are coming.
I mean, not me.
I mean,I want to fight.
I mean, oh, shoot...I've got the horse.
I mean, but ifanyone else wants to go?
MAN:I'll go.

I need her to read mea bedtime story.
Oh, she's busy withthe blood drive.
Maybe I can help.
How about I read youthis book?
It's calledApathetic George.

Okay, I've had enough.All right,you know what,
I know something that will helpyou sleep. Wait here.
Well, I hope so.Because I've tried everything.
Counting sheep,thinking sleepy thoughts.
I even hired the Sandman.
Sand and sand andsand and sand
and sand and sandand good night!
Okay, I'll give youa tiny bit of this.
It should help you sleep.What is it?
It's cough syrup.It's not really for kids,
but a capfulis pretty harmless.
Mmm.
Oh, so this is what Lil Waynekeeps almost dying from.
Ah, this is so relaxing.
I could get used to this.
Like the way I got used towearing European diapers.
Don't mind me.
I'm just grabbinga little cheese and vino.
If anybody needs me,I'll be poolside
next to my weirdly hotgirlfriend with dark teeth.
Well, Lois, I'mdone giving blood.
Just ask this guy.
(&#224; la Dracula):Is true, Lois.
I sucked him dry.
He gave a blooddonation as well.
Peter, knock it off.Just give some blood,
get your cookieand be done with it.
Cookie?Yes, Peter.
There are cookiesfor everyone who donates.
Well, I already atetwo wedding cakes,
but I guess I couldgo for a cookie.
All right, I'll do it.
Peter, you're doinga good thing.
Thanks, Lois, but you gotto promise you'll warn me
before they stickthat needle in me.
Actually, wejust finished.
Wow, that wasn't so bad.
See, Peter? And nowyou can have a cookie.
Oh, awesome!
Mmm. Mmm. Oh, my God,th-these are delicious.
Lois, you made these?
Yeah, I found oneof my grandmother's old recipes,
so I thought I'd make a specialbatch for the blood drive.
Well, I'm glad you did.These cookies are amazing.
They're even tastierthan Connie Britton's hair.
(licking sounds)
Mmm. God, yourhair is delicious.
Who are you?

(canned laughter)
ANNOUNCER:TV, that thingyou used to watch.
Oh, these are incredible.
Hey, you know something?
If we sold these, we couldmake a ton of money.

Are you serious?Yeah, why not?
I mean, if George Foremancan make electric grills,
we can do this.
I mean, I've seen that guyget punched in the face
a thousand times, and nowhe's making science stuff.
Who'd think that idiotwould still be walking around
and Muhammad Alican't even talk anymore?
You know, having our own storecould be kind of fun.
And you'd really do it with me?
Absolutely.
Oh, Peter, that actually soundskind of romantic.
I always wanted you and meto work on a project together.
Oh, let's do it!
All right! Now, let'sturn up the TV real loud

for the North Dakotaboard of tourism.
PETER:Hi. Do you like South Dakota
but don't wantto see Mount Rushmore?
Come to North Dakota.
It's just a very long drivefrom wherever you live.
Best of all,most of the good license plates
aren't taken yet.
Imagine coming hereand having "Cool Dude"
or "Yay Jews"
or "Boo Jews,"
depending on where you standon Jews.
North Dakota.
We're not even the best Dakota.
Stewie,what are you doing?
Huh? Oh, Brian,oh, there you are.
I've been... I've been lookingall over the table for you.
You know, I've got to tellyou, this stuff you gave me

I was outlike a light.
And, you know, normally,I'm up five or six times
to scream and defecate.But you know what?
I slept straightthrough.
Stewie, I told you,there's alcohol in that.
It's not for kids.
You're not for kids.(laughs)
Stewie, you're drunk.(slurring)
Oh, Brian's all serious.
"Oh, I don't... I don'tdrink in the morning
because I've gotto land a plane."
(laughs)
All right, come on, I've gotto drive you to daycare.
Okay, okay, it's all right.C-Calm down, calm down.
Uh, uh, oh. Oh, I think I...
I think I've put my shoeson the wrong feet.
Is it 9:15 already?
Lois, we got to go!
You know, I've got allthe papers for the loan officer,
but, I got to admit,I'm a little nervous.
Don't worry, we're gonnaget this loan, no problem.
And if you get nervous,just do what I always do,
picture youraudience naked.
Good afternoon,Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
Aah! Get that enormousthing out of my face!
I'll be your loan officer,so why don't you have a seat
and tell meabout your business.
Our businessis cookies.
Now let me askyou a question.
You everheard of money?Yes.
Good, good. We'reon the same page.
Now, sir, let me askyou something else.
Can you name one successfulcompany that isn't cookie-based?
Microsoft.
Peter, I'll handle this.
Uh, my husband and I would liketo open a cookie store.
We've done all the research,
and I'm very confidentwe can turn a profit.
I've brought some samplesif you'd like to try one.
She said one.
Take one.
Mmm. Well,these are delicious.
Let me just run thisby my supervisor.
Yes!
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,this bank would like
to help you startyour business.
Really?!Oh, that's fantastic!
And if you haveany other questions,
you can call meat any time.
(phone rings)
(groggily):Hello?
PETER:How far away are the stars?
Brian! Brian!
Hold-hold on one second.
I'll be right with you,Mr. Duckford.
Brian!What?
Let's order... I was justthinking, let's order a kebab.
A what?A kebab.
But I... but I want itin this order:
vegetable, meat, meat,
vegetable, meat.
And, uh, Mr. Duckfordwould like some quackers.
(laughs)Can I leave now?
No, no, Bri... No, you can't.Brian, I need your help.
I've made a seriesof small poops in my bath,
and I need you to scoop them outwith this fishnet.
Yeah, I'm not doing that.You have to.
You're my butler.I'm not your butler.
I know, but wouldn'tit be great if you were?
It'd be... I'd be so happy.
In fact, the only thingthat would make me happier is...
would... is... would be if thistub was filled with "yawgurt."
Can you... can you get mesome yawgurt?
Is the yawgurt shopstill open?
Is there... is there some placeto dial up yawgurt?
Stop saying that.What's the best skin yawgurt?
Who can... who can prepare mea nice yawgurt treatment?
If you say it like that onemore time, I'm gonna drown you.
Yawgurt. Uh, see?
You're not... you're notgonna do anything.
Hey, hey, Brian,am I a good little guy?
This spacewill be perfect, Peter.
Yeah, it sure will, Lois.
Now all we got to dois name the store.
Ooh, ooh, I got it.
Peter's Wife's Cookies.
(gasps)I love it.
And I love you.
Really?Yes.
You know, we did so-sobuilding a family,
but this business--
I think we can reallyknock it out of the park.
Oh, we sure can, Lois.
We're gonna be a great team.
Like Moses and his buddy wholiked to collect seashells.
Yay!
(exclaims)I can't believe it, Peter.
Our first dayof business.
All right. Well,we have got work to do,
so let's roll up our sleevesand get right to it.
There's a lot to do,so we can't be afraid
to just roll up our sleevesand get the job done.
We can't be hands-off managers.
We got to roll up our sleevesand just dig in.
Peter, your armsare turning purple.
Purple with success.That's the color of money.
You got to do the work of twomen and pay yourself for one.
Just roll up those sleevesand address the task at hand,
whatever it may be, not shyingaway from the dirty work,
but just rolling up our sleevesand having at it.
Success is not given.It is taken.
It's time to get in the gameand get dirty.
All right, I'm going to lunch.
Uh, yes, I'd likea chocolate chip cookie.
Elmer!
What, Mom? You promisedI could get a cookie
if I finishedall my surgery.
Did you?
Yeah.All of it?
Um...Get back there.
I'm gonna do it.
What does it matterwhen I do it?
Lois, Lois, lock the door.Why?
It's that lady who comesin, tries a sample,
and then whispers abouthow bad she is. Hey.
Oh, my God, you havechocolate macadamia nut?
Oh, could I just trya little sample?
(whispers):Oh, I'm so bad.
Uh, sure.
You gonna buy acookie this time?
Oh, I better juststick with the sample.
I'm so bad.
But at leastI know I'm bad,
so that makes mea little less bad.
Or worse.
That was the right thingto do, Peter.
Oh, boy, it's beenreally slow.
I mean, if it doesn'tpick up soon,
we're not gonna stayin business very long.
Don't you worry,Lois, you keep baking,
I'll drum up some business.
We just got to thinkoutside the box,
like the makers ofDreyer's ice cream.
Guys, I've said it before,and I'll say it again:
When people go tothe supermarket,
they need somethingto look at
before they chooseH&#227;agen-Dazs.
Hey, dude, can you pass mea speck of Spazz?
Sorry, brah,all out.
You want a cubeof Froosh?
Nah, I'm not into Froosh.
I got a tearof Laser Dragon.
Can I handle it?
I don't know.Can you?
ANNOUNCER:Gum! What the hell is going on?!
(sighs) I don't knowwhat to do, you guys.
The cookie shopis tanking.
If it fails,we're screwed.
My God,what does it take
to get peopleto buy a damn cookie?
Peter, let metell you something.
I spend $600 a month
on scented candlesat the farmer's market
just because there'sa hot chick selling them.
So what are you saying?
You just braggingabout candles?
That's a weird thingto brag about.
No, I'm sayingsex sells.
Trust me,you get a few hotties
in that cookie shopof yours,
I bet your saleswill go up.
Giggity.
That was an unearnedgiggity, Quagmire.
I said "up."
No?
No.No.
Well, I'll tryanything, Quagmire,
'cause I actually likerunning that cookie shop.
It's way betterthan that job I had
telemarketingto buttholes.
MAN:Hello?
Sorry, wrong number.
MAN 2:Hello?
Sorry, wrong number.
(passing gas)
And how are you today, sir?
Oh, my God.
Customers.
What the hell?
(indistinct conversations)
Peter, what did you do?
I saved our business.
And don't worry,I only hired women
whose names arecookie-related.
Lois, meetCookie, Sugar,
Spice, Cinnamon,Brown Sugar
and Butter.
Oh, hey,Butter.
Some guyslike Butter.
Peter, you turned our storeinto a strip club.
And I don't likewhat this place has become.
You mean hugelyprofitable?
We made all that today?
Well, it wastwice as much,
but I had to bail outCinnamon's kid.
Thanks, Mr. Peter.
This guy's the best.
Well, I guess businessis better than ever.
That's the spirit, Lois.
Just you watch, we'llbe a bigger success
than Richard Branson.
Hey, where's the businessguy in this boardroom?
It couldn't be thattan, long-haired guy
with the white linenpants, could it?
It is!
And now, to my amphibioussky submarine.
I have way too much money!
(thumping)
Come on, get-get down there,
you old bag.
There we go.
Stewie, what are you doing?
Being awesome.
Whoa, whoa,wait, wait.
You're in nocondition to drive.
I'm fine to drive.I'm so fine.
You s...I can do all the tests.
See?I can touch my nose.
I can touch my...
&#9834; Head, shoulders, kneesand toes, knees and toes. &#9834;
Stop it.
No, you stop it.
You stop it, Brian.
You're interfering
with my professionalbusiness.
Where's the radio?
(gasps)Oh, my God, are you okay?
No. I don't feel so good.
We should probablyexchange numbers.
Okay. I'm a ten,you're a four.
(cackles)
&#9834; &#9834;
This one's our newchocolate white chocolate,
and for everydozen we sell,
we donate 50 cents
to Operation Smile.
Yeah, nobody'slistening to you.
They're all watching Sugar
write frostingswears on her jugs.
(giggles)
She just wrote"vagina" on her boobs.
That doesn't evenmake any sense.
She's doing what?
I told her ten minutes ago
to put another batchof oatmeal in the oven.
Oh, that doughis gone, Lois.
I warmed it upand put it behind
those waist-highholes in the wall.
Is it spaghetti?A bowl of grapes?
Ooh, this is the besthaunted house ever.
Peter, this is disgusting.
I know we made a few changes,
but this store shouldstill be about selling cookies.
Well, you're never gonnasell any looking like that.
There. Now you'reready to sell cookies.
You know what?
That's it. I'm done.
I don't know why I everlet you talk me into this...
this...whatever this is now.
It's a strip club thatgives away free cookies.
Ugh.
Oh, crap.
I should've knownsomething was up
when I saw all thosecars out front.
Stewie, why don't youcome and have a seat
with all your friends here?
We have somethingto say to you.
I'll go first.
"Stewie, I rememberthe day you were born.
"I thought to myself,here's a kid
"who's got a white,empty canvas
stretched outin front of him."
Oh, please.What... Who...
What is this...What is this,
the circleof perfect people?
Who are youto judge me?
Mis-Mister...Mister Giraffe,
who lets l-little boysgrind on his rump.
Mr. Octopus, who letslittle boys grind on his rump.
Every one of youhas your own problems.
Yeah, but you'rethe only one who almost
killed a kid yesterday.
Yeah, well, that's, d...That's because that...
'Cause, because thatkid... That's because...
because that... 'ca...because that kid...
that kid...(sobs)
I know.
Oh, Brian.
Who am I?
I don't have a cough,and my sinuses
are remarkablywide open.
But I have a problem.
Good. Admitting itis the first step.
But don't worry,I'll get you through it.
Thank you, Brian.
You're welcome, Stewie.
Now, if you'll excuse me,I have to go to Chris's room.
We're doinga masturbation intervention.
I got a bunch of his friendssitting in a circle in there...
Oh, dear God.
Oh. Hey.
Lois, before yousay anything,
there's somethingimportant I want to tell you.
After you left, I atecookie dough off the stomach
of a 20-year-old,and then I vomited
and all the girlslaughed at me,
and then it came out that theyall think I'm fat and old.
Is that it?
I guess what I'm tryingto say is...
I was wrong to choosesexiness over my wife.
Peter, what are you doing?
What-what was that?
Oh, back at the store,I, uh, tucked my boner
into the waistband of my pantsand now it's sitting weird.
That's your apology?
Well, that and this.
Oh, Peter, did...
did you bake this?
Yeah. I love you, Lois.
I really likedhaving a store with you,
and I'm...I'm sorry I messed it up.
I was only trying to help.
I know, Peter.
So you wantto split this with me?
Uh, I wouldn't.Butter helped me with it,
and she haschlamydia fingers.
Well, it was funhaving our own store.
But from now on,my cookies
are onlyfor these customers.
(laughs)Oh, Mom.
So, Mom, what are yougonna do with the shop?
Well, I talkedto the bank,
and they agreedto take it back.
Me love Cookie. Om, nom, nom,nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom... </div>\t'
