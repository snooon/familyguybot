&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
ANNOUNCER: We now return toD.J. Butcher: Deejay Butcher.
&#9834; &#9834;
(shouting over music):Hey, bro!
Hey! You requesting a song orordering some sliced meat?
Meat! Half a poundof turkey, please.
You want a sample?
You mean likea slice of turkey,
or like a short sectionof one musical recording
that's been digitally repurposedto be part of a new song?
I don't know.
I might quit this job.
God, late-night TVis all terrible.
Oh, we don't haveto watch this.
We could turn to channel 875and watch Conan.
Here, let me seewhat else is on.
(laughter, applause)
In honor of Sammy,on the bus ride over here,
we all sat in the back.
(laughter)
Lucille Ball wasback there with us,
and I saw her smoking a Cuban.
Then Desi zipped up his fly.
(laughter)
(chuckles)Whose wedding is this?
It's hilarious.
Peter, it's not a wedding,it's an infomercial
for The Dean MartinCelebrity Roasts.
Wait, you mean Comedy Centraldidn't invent those?
No.
Well, what about funny news?
Did they invent that?
N-Not really.
But they invented comedy.
They didn'tinvent anything.
Well, they centralized it,that we know.
Man, look at these people.
They don't breathe.
They just drinkand smoke and laugh.
I want to do that.
What are youtalking about?
You want tohave a roast?
Yeah! Look, he's the manof the hour.
Everybody loves him.
They got his picturein a circle.
How do they do that?
Pictures come in squares.
Hey, Cleveland,how tall are you?
I don't know.
Cadillac come upto about here on me.
All right, so I guess I amthe tallest one of us.
What are you talkingabout? I'm six-two.
Says so right here onmy driver's license.
Yeah, that-thatdoesn't count.
Why not?
You're gonnamake me say it?
Lay me outon the floor.
I'm six-two.
Hey, you guys.
Peter, how tall am I?
I don't know,how tall is a mailbox?
You're abouta mailbox.
But listen, I-I wantyou guys to roast me.
What, you meanlike they do on TV?
That's right, I want to bethe man of the hour.
And I want all my palsto give me a good ribbing.
Can we work blue,like Marlin Johnson?
&#9834; Oh-ee, oh-ee,hey-yo, ha. &#9834;
Oh, you knowit, homey!
Huh, all right,that could be fun.
Great. And you fellasshouldn't pull any punches.
Just let me have it.
Nothing is off-limits.
Geez, Peter,you're more excited
than Adrian Petersonat an arboretum.
Daddy, what kindof tree is that?
Man, I want to beat youwith so many things around here.
JOE: Ladies and gentlemenand people who have wandered in
from the Chinese weddingnext door,
welcome to the roastof Peter Griffin,
with your roast masterGlenn Quagmire.
(applause)
Thank you, thank you,thank you very much.
Joe, I'd tell youto take your seat,
but I'd beabout 15 years too late.
(laughter)
Ha! And we're off.
Well, what can I say about theman of the hour, Peter Griffin?
Oh, boy, hereit comes.
Well, first off,Peter's always been special.
In high school,he didn't play sports,
but he did wear a helmet.
(laughter)
(chuckles)
All right, that's kind of funny.
Tough, but fair.
You know, Peter, I loveyour chin, but I got to ask.
What's it likegoing through life
with a scrotumso close to your mouth?
You know what, hold on.
I'll just askyour teenage daughter.
(laughter)
That... that's inappropriate.
You know, Peter'schallenging the stereotype
of Irish guys being fat,drunk and stupid
by throwing "a little gay"in there, too.
(laughter)
Oh, nice, homophobia.
But I got to say, the worst partof being Peter's friend is
knowing that eventuallyyou're gonna have to be
the fat-ass's pallbearer.
Lift with the legs,right fellas?
(laughter)
P-People think I'm fat?
But seriously, everyone, let'shave a big round of applause
for the real hero tonight:Peter's chair.
(chuckles) How youholding up, buddy?
(laughter)
Two chair jokesin the same monologue.
Sloppy.
Peter's got a small penis,
but, hey, nothinggrows in the shade.
This just in...
is what Peter had to say tohis wife on their wedding night
so she knew it wasactually happening.
Peter's so ugly,he couldn't get raped
in our holding celldown at the station.
For those of you who don't know,
we have a real serious problemwith people getting raped
in our holding celldown at the station.
Hi, I'm Professor Comedy.
QUAGMIRE:No! (boos)
Peter, you're loud,you can't hold down a job,
and you got high blood pressure.
You could be a black guy if yourding-a-ling wasn't so damn tiny.
LOIS: (laughs)How does everyone know?!
Peter moves his lipswhile he's reading,
'cause he's tryingto eat the book.
Roasted!
You know, as Lois's father,
I hate the thought of herhaving sex with Peter.
LOIS:And so do I!
Damn it, Lois, you steppedon my punch line!
Shut up! You're drunk!
Stop serving her!
I asked Peterwhat he got on his S.A.T.s.
He said, "Mayonnaise."
Peter's so fat and stupid,Lamar Odom tried to bang him.
(laughter)
Well, ladies and gentlemen,now that we've had our fun,
it's time to give our man of thehour a chance to have his say.
Please put your hands togetherfor Peter Griffin!
(applause)
Okay, yeah,I got something to say.
Screw all you guys!
I hope you all eat turdsand die!
None of you bastardsare my friends no more!
(cries)
Brian was theworst one.
Family, I havean announcement to make.
Peter, we're eating.
Just tell us what color it wasand be done with it.
On account of my buddiesall being nasty sons of bitches,
I've decided I'm gonnafind new friends.
Oh, come on, you'reoverreacting.
The roast wasyour idea.
You asked them tomake fun of you.
Yeah, but I thoughtthey'd stick to material
about how I'm too handsometo work at a brewery,
or-or how I have tinylittle baby sneezes.
(imitates baby sneeze)
I'm sure it was allmeant in good fun.
Yeah, it was supposed to be fun,but it was humiliating.
I felt likea premature volcano.
I just think you're areally cool island,
and I'd like toget to know...
Oh, God!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry--you're just so pretty.
Please, don't tellthe other islands.
I've been thinking.
Maybe I got to find friends whocan't make fun of my appearance
'cause they'reweird-looking themselves.
Like those two bearded dwarveswalking across the street there.
Hey, will you beardeddwarves be friends with me?
We, sir, areItalian children.
Good day.
Thanks for hanging outwith me.
I never thought of my kids'principal as being a friend.
Well, "pal" is rightthere in the name, Peter.
(chuckles)Yeah.
Hey, it's cool you gotthe keys to the school,
and we can hang outwhen no one else is here.
What should we do?
Oh, I got a few ideas.
Wow, I've never drankso much milk in my life.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
What other ideas you got?
How about this secondfridge of milk?
Uh, how much milkdo you drink?
I just drink milk untilsomebody stops me.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just not meantto find a new group of friends.
Well, Peter, you're alwayswelcome to hang out with me.
Yeah, but I'm talkingabout the kind of friend
that doesn't bark at horseswhen I'm watching a movie.
Fine, fine, you want to gettrampled in your living room?
Be my guest.
It's just... (sighs)
I don't know, I-I don't seemto fit in anywhere.
(sighs) All right, I'm gonnago get some more coffee
and maybe a grossmicrowaved sandwich.
Excuse me.
Can I please haveanother no-foam latte?
Uh, yeah, sure.
But, you know,I don't work here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You look just likeone of the baristas.
He doesn't lookthat much like me.
WOMAN:I think she meant me.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I could see that.
Hey, we should make out.
You got it, mister.
(chuckles)Double-foam, am I right?
(laughs)
You're funny.
Yeah. Oh, my God,you're so twisted.
I'm Jamie, and this isBecca and Karen.
You want to join us?
Sure.Great.
We were just debatingif Jamie should hook up
with this guy she meta few nights ago.
Okay, I want the deets,like, yesterday.
Wh-What the hell?Did I just say that?
You sure did.
You're a naturalat this.
Wh-What is "this"?
It's what we do!
(women whoop)
Wow, you know,I know I just met you guys,
but I've kind of been lookingfor a new group of friends.
D-Do you maybe have roomfor one more?
Are you good at talkingabout how busy you are?
Because that's a lotof what this is.
Ugh, yeah, but don't talkto me about anything
until I've hadmy morning coffee,
'cause it's likeI can't even deal.
Well, I think I speakfor all of us when I say
we'd love to have you inour group of girlfriends.
Oh, my God,that's awesome!
Hey, can I be the one
who laugh-screamsreally loud at restaurants?
As long as you'repicking up the check.
(laugh-screams)
Oh, we're gonna ruinso many people's evenings!
Oh, boy, I'm blendingright in with you gals.
Like a panda bearon a bed full of pillows.
I'm hiding from the zoo.
They want me to have a baby.
I don't want to have a baby!
Hey, isn't it funnythat you guys came over
for a dinner party,and all we're doing is
standing in thekitchen, drinking wine?
All ourtoothbrushes were
in that one woman'sglass this morning.
Girls, it is so nice tobe part of a group again.
And I'm havingthe best time.
Especially yesterday whenwe all got mammograms.
If I have cancer,we're all going to Brazil.
So what's for dinner?
You said we werehaving Italian?
Yeah, and then Irealized I'm not good
at makingfettuccine Alfredo,
but I am good atmaking reservations.
(laughter)
Do you get it?
Oh, God, I'm so bad.
Stewie, it's timefor your bath.
Oh, what'sgoing on in here?
Oh, hey, Lois.
Hey, these aremy new friends:
Jamie, Karenand Becca.
Karen's the onewith the mommy blog,
so if you think you know herfrom somewhere, that's where.
Oh, nice to meetyou all.
Would you like tojoin us for dinner?
Oh, no, I don't wantto get in the way.
Besides, I got to getthis little man in the tub.
Great. Now they're allpicturing my wiener.
Oh, thank God.
For a second, I thoughtshe was gonna come with us.
What?
Seriously, Peter,how do you live with her?
I know, that voice.Ugh.
And what is that hair color?
Creamy French Dressing?
(women laughing)
Oh, I love it.I love it.
(chuckles weakly)
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey, if you think that's funny,
she once had a miscarriageoutside a Petco.
I still have the securitycamera footage somewhere.
(women laughing)
Peter, I'm your conscience,Jiminy Cricket.
Ah! Bug!
Andrea, y-you set a placefor Jiminy again.
Oh... so I did.
Why?!
Why did he have to go aroundtelling strangers what to do?
Wasn't being a pediatriconcologist enough for him?!
(sobbing)
He hit on meat your wedding.
Ah, let's see, what else?What else? What else?
Oh, I-I got one.I got one.
Lois tried to give CPR toa kid at a wedding once,
and when she knelt down,
she accidentally high-heeledher own stink hole.
(women laughing)
Peter, your wifeis such a pig.
Oh, I don't knowabout that, Jamie.
Pigs eat slop,Lois only cooks it.
(laughter)
What the hell?
Peter, can I speakwith you for a second?
Oh, hang on, guys,I got to talk to my dog.
What the hellare you doing?
I'm just gabbingwith the girls.
You know our cycleshave lined up?
Mine's from wiping too hard.
You're saying horrible thingsabout Lois.
Oh, yeah,it cracks up the ladies.
Yesterday, Karen laughed so hard
she popped a buttonon her jeans.
And then she cried.
Peter, Loisis your wife.
You should bedefending her,
not talking trash andgossiping behind her back
like some kind ofMidwestern teenager.
(Midwestern accent):Did you gals hearabout Ally Gallagher?
She let Alan Ackermansmack her in the back
with his tallywhackerbehind the snack shack.
What?Nobody herein Maryland
understands a singleword you're saying.
You should moveback to Minnesota.
I can't go back.
I SnapchattedMatt Gackerack
a Kodak of my ass crack.
Hey, Lois?
I did something badI need to tell you about.
Peter, I know.
You used some of my magazinesfor your fake ransom notes.
It's okay.
No, no, no, no,that's not it.
But did you put the icecream where the guy said?
Because he willhurt your family.
Look, the thing is,me and my new girlfriends,
we've kind of beentalking trash about you
and laughingbehind your back.
Peter, of courseyour new friends
have been talking crap about me.
That's what women do.
What?
So... you're not mad?
Well, I'm not thrilled,but I understand what it's like
to be friends with women.
I'm sure they talk trashabout you behind your back.
They mostcertainly do not!
I guarantee you thatas soon as you leave the room,
they tear you to shreds.
That's not true.
If it was, I would'vefigured it out.
Just like I figured out who wasstealing my lunch at work.
(dramatic music playing)
Next time there's a sandwichin the fridge
with somebody's name on it,don't eat it, scumbag!
Please, you don't understand!
Oh, I understand.
That lunch didn'thave your name on it,
but this bullet does.
My name is Peter, too...!
Ugh, have you guys seenthe new Jessica Biel movie?
I-I don't getwhat men see in her.
Um, her dumper?
I just think she'sreally plain-looking.
She kind of annoys me.
You know who's really beautiful?
Joan Allen.
Yes!Uh, stunning.
Yeah, uh... I-I think, um...
Um, I'm maybe gonnago use the restroom
and let you guys talk about
whatever you're gonnatalk about.
Huh, I guess Peter madeit to the bathroom,
'cause I can't feelhim walking anymore.
I know.
"Fee-fi-fo-fum!"Right?
(women laughing)
And what aboutthose drugstore glasses?
These aren't drugstore glasses,
they came froma doctor Halloween costume.
(sighs)
Lois was right.
They are making fun of mebehind my back.
They're like a nasty wolf pack.
Hey, man,just a heads-up:
instead of howlingat the moon tonight,
we're all gonna yell"cock-a-doodle-doo!"
Really?
That seems weird.
I'm just trying to make sureyou don't look silly.
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
(laughter)
What an idiot!
He actually believed me!
That's what a rooster says,not a wolf!
(growling)
Hi, Daddy!How was howling at the moon?
(slurring): Shut up!Why aren't you asleep?
Why isn't he asleep?
Leave him alone!
Have you beendrinking again, Phil?
That's none ofyour business!
I never wanted a cub!
Get out!
Get out nowand don't ever come back!
Hey, buddy,want to get high?
Oh, my God. Phil?
Hey... Robert.
Wow.
Ah, hey,listen, man...
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
(laughter)
(sobbing)
"Cock-a-doodle-doo"is a passion project
I'd been mulling over for years,
and when Family Guy gave methe opportunity to shoot it,
I knew there was only one actor
who could portrayPhil the Wolf: Glenn Quagmire.
Peter gave me a beer that tastedfunny, and when I woke up,
I was wearing lipstickand a wolf suit.
Lois, you were right.
Those womenwere talking about me.
Oh, dear.What did they say?
I don't even remember,there was such a long cutaway,
but I know it was really mean.
Oh, I'm sosorry, Peter.
So what do I do now?
Confront them face-to-faceand explain why I'm angry?
Of course not.
Being friends with women isway more complex than that.
You need to be moreunderhanded and vicious.
You and I will get revengeon those bitches lady-style.
Really?
We'll-we'll do it together?
Yeah, it'll be fun.
Like when we watchedBattlestar Galactica together.
Now, which Cylon is that?
Ah, I-I don't know.
I think it's Number Six.
Wait, i-is thatthe same Number Six
that had sex with Dr. Baltar?
I don't... I've been...I've been watching this
the same exact amountof time you have, Lois.
I don't knowanything you don't.
Ooh, what does that green buttonon the far panel do?
How in God's namewould I know that?!
I don't know!
It's green, so it probablymakes something go.
PETER:Hello?
Peter, where are you?
I thought we were gonnago after Becca.
Way ahead of you, Lois.I just cut her brakes.
What?!
Don't you thinkthat's a little dangerous?
Hey, you're the one who said weshould try to ruin her marriage.
She bangs up her car,her husband's gonna be furious.
(horns honking,tires screeching)
What was that?
Oh, I-I just ran a red light.
My car won't slow downfor some reason.
Anyway, this isgonna be awesome.
Geez, I'm going, like, 95.
Peter, are you sureyou didn't cut your brakes?
That's ridiculous.Why would I cut my own...
Kids, get out of the way!I can't stop!
(kids screaming, horn honking)
All right, Peter,next is Jamie.
Now, what's the mostimportant thing in her life?
Oh, that's easy.
Her daughter Emilyis a competitive diver.
The whole family's dream
is that she gets a spoton the U.S. Olympic Team.
Okay, so get a lead pipe andbust this girl's kneecaps.
No, no, no, Lois.
That's not howwe're gonna do this.
&#9834; Out on the streets &#9834;
&#9834; That's where we'll meet &#9834;
&#9834; You make the night &#9834;
&#9834; I always cross the line &#9834;
&#9834; Tightened our belts &#9834;
&#9834; Abused ourselves &#9834;
&#9834; Get in our way &#9834;
&#9834; We'll put you on your shelf &#9834;
&#9834; Round and round &#9834;
&#9834; With love we'll find a way &#9834;
&#9834; Just give it time &#9834;
&#9834; Round and round &#9834;
&#9834; What comes aroundgoes around &#9834;
&#9834; I'll tell you why &#9834;
&#9834; Yeah &#9834;
&#9834; &#9834;
(sobbing)
That's how we'regonna do this.
(elegant piano music playing)
(laughs)
Okay, next is Karen.
Now, she's been planning herdaughter's wedding for a year.
If it doesn't go perfectly,she'll be crushed.
Already on it, Lois.
I bribed one ofthe busboys.
He has a little surpriseplanned for her.
(man screams)
GUEST: Oh, my God!Somebody stabbed the groom!
(guests screaming)
(sobbing)
Oh, no,it's not a perfect day.
(sobbing)
Well, we got thosebitches good, huh, Peter?
Yeah, thanks, Lois.
And you were right.
Being friends with womenis way too complicated
and way toointense for me.
Now let me just pay the busboyand we can get out of here.
Ah! I knew he didn'tunderstand the plan!
Hey, guys.Oh, hey, Peter.
Look, I-I'm real sorryI got so worked up at my roast.
And if you're willing,
I'd like to be friendswith you guys again.
Because men mightpunch you in the gut
and call you a fat idiot,
but at least they do itto your face and own it.
You were mad at us?
Yeah, we ain't spokein a week.
I thought you were out of town.
People come, people go.I didn't give no mind.
So we're-we'refriends again?
We were never not friends,you idiot.
I love you guys.
Guys are the best.
Not women.
