(SINGING) It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex an TV
But where are those
good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do
All the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He's a family guy
- Hello, I'm Brian Griffin.
- And I'm Stewie Griffin.
A few years ago, we did
an episode called "Viewer Mail"

where you, our fans, wrote in
and suggested ideas for new episodes.
Well, it's 10 years later,
but you're still sending in ideas.
To Rashad in Little Rock,
We wanna let you know
we kicked around your idea,
"Make the baby go wild" for a while.
Couldn't really find an angle on it.
Here's one from Lee Mills of Iowa.
Lee writes, "Dear Family Guy, 
was your show based on anything?"
That's a great question, Lee.
In fact, Family Guy is based on an American
television series called The Simpsons.
(CHUCKLES)
Actually, Family Guy, much like The Office,
is based on a British series called
Chap of the Manor. Let's watch.

MAN ON TV: We now return to Britain's
most popular game show...
(BRITISH AUDIENCE READING OUT)
- Do go ahead, then.
- Oh, no, you first.
- Wouldn't dream of it.
- Too kind, really, I insist.
Wouldn't be proper of me.
- I appreciate your courtesy.
- Likewise.
Well, we're all out of time.
Join us same time tomorrow,
if it's not entirely inconvenient for you.
If so, of course, we do understand
and we do apologize in advance.
This has all been an imposition.
I'm so dreadfully sorry.
- Sorry!
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Sorry, everyone!
All right, kids, enough telly.
I hope everyone's peckish
for some boiled lamb shank.
None for me, Lydia.
I'm meeting me mates down at the pub.
Again? But Neville, you spend all your time
down at the Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf
and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock.
And that's where you're wrong.
The Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf
and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock
is for tossers.
We're meeting at the Dog and Cat and Bull
and Whistle and Fiddle and Cock
and Pig and Wolfand Carriage
and Fife and Other Wolf.
But I need you to stay
and have a chat with Collingsworth.
I found him with another fag in his mouth
this morning.
Oh, is that right? So you fancy fags, do you?
Well, here. Have a whole carton of fags!
I just want a comely lass
to look upon me with favor.
I look on you with favor.
I look on all of you with favor.
Shut up, British Meg.
(EXAGGERATED TEXAN ACCENT)
Look at Lydia.
What a two-bit Wichita whore.
One of these days,
she's gonna wake up kilt.
Ah, matricide. Yet another
of your childhood whims.
No, it ain't. l'm gonna follow through with...
Wait, why'd you say it like that?
Cutaway, sir?
Yes, that's good, then.
Friends, family, and characters random,
to bring you joy and laughter in tandem,
to divert and dazzle is our intention,
so sit back, relax and enjoy our invention.
Ah, I love summer.
Good evening, Billingsbury.
I'm Clive Crowley.
Coming up,
a man with a gun and two bullets
has taken over the city of Manchester.
But first, our top story tonight,
Her Majesty The Queen
will be passing through
our very town tomorrow.
With details, we now go live
to Indian reporter Tricia Dasgupta.
(EXAGGERATED INDIAN ACCENT)
Oh, my golly, there is much commotion.
Thank you, Tricia. After the interval, find
out which 12 football teams tied tonight.
The Queen's coming to Billingsbury?
That's bloody sweet!
You know, I'm actually a relation
of the Royal Family.
You most certainly are not.
Where would you get that idea?
Me mum used to claim she was a Windsor.
And I always heard me nana
talk about how she took a duke.
Must've been a difficult marriage, too,
'cause every afternoon she'd be
bellyaching about her bloody duke.
I think you just had a gross grandmother.
No, I'm quite sure of it.
And to prove it, l'm gonna nick one of the
Queen's hairs during her visit tomorrow.
And when the DNA proves a match,
you'll see l'm royalty.
The Queen, eh? I'd like to mash my banger
in her blood pudding.
Googity. Googity. Glop.
- Hello, lads.
- Oh, hello, Seamus.
Right fine performance
at the cricket match today.
Aye. I was spirited
to have you down there watching me.
ANNOUNCER: Well, it's a brilliant day
for a long and confusing game of cricket.
The field is teeming with men in helmets
who don't seem like they need helmets,
and men not in helmets who seem like
they probably should be wearing helmets.
Oh, he's batted it clear out of the stadium.
Is that good?
We don't know, but it's what we do!
- (HESITANTLY) Yay!
- Boo!
Boo!
Oh, my goodness,
the Queen is going to be here presently.
This is oh-so-exciting!
My favorite part before the Queen arrives
is yelling "Wanker!" at Prince Charles
as he passes.
- Wanker!
- Wanker!
I know, I know.
- Wanker!
- Wanker!
Yes, I know. Yes.
- Wanker!
- You're a wanker!
- Wanker!
- Right, quite right. Spot on. He's got it.
I say, a lot of people
have turned out to see the Queen.
Should make for a grand day.
Hey, watch it there.
- Good show, old chap.
- Well played.
Here she comes!
(CROWD MURMURING)
Very well. Time for action. A lock
of the Queen's hair shall soon be mine.
Here she comes. Have at it, then.
Crikey! This is a haircut fit for a queen!
Oh, bloody hell! All right, time for Plan B.
Let's go!
I'm not going any lower.
Well, Father, you gave it a good go.
Oh, we're not done yet. Come on!
(TIRES SCREECH)
Queen! Queen! Give me some of your hair!
Come on, Queen! Don't be a bitch!
Get us away from that lunatic!
She's heading into that tunnel!
(CRASHING)
(HORSE NEIGHS)
GUARD: (GASPS)
Dear God! The Queen's dead!
(BOTH WHISTLING)
All right, Collingsworth, I got a hair.
Now, just walk away casual-like
and we're in the clear.
Oh, no! Here come the coppers!
(YAKETY SAX PLAYING)
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Bugger.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Bugger.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Bugger.
Well, it turns out l'm not royalty.
Shame about the Queen, though.
Yeah, I reckon she's with Jesus Christ
in heaven now. (SPITS)
(METALLIC DING)
Well, I'm just happy our family
is safe and sound,
back in our cozy row house.
Row house.
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to the
Comedy Central Roast of Robin Williams.
Oh, man, Robin Williams is my favorite.
He must be getting recognized
for all his contributions to show business.
I don't think that's what a roast is.
Robin, as a comic, it's an honor
to be up here roasting you.
As a moviegoer,
I want to punch you in the face.
(TV SHOW AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Oh, that's funny. Advocate violence.
And let's face it, Mork,
you're getting Nanu-Na-old!
(TV SHOW AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Stop it! You stop it! Robin Williams
has a manic gift that gladdens a sad world,
and all he asks in return
is our unceasing attention!
How can you allow this?
Robin Williams has given us
nothing but joy!
I wish everyone was Robin Williams!
(SCREAMS)
(SIZZLING)
Boy, that looks enticing.
Ooh!
Yeah, this is nice.
Oh, my God. What happened?
You were in a coma,
and then I kissed you, and you woke up.
(MUMBLES) Like, two days later.
Anyway, all your numbers are normal.
- What numbers?
- No idea.
Well, congratulations.
You're gonna be just fine.
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)
Oh, my God! You're Robin Williams!
Ding! Thank you for playing
That's Obvious!
Tell him what he's won, Cletus.
(HICK ACCENT) Money!
Ho-ho! Money.
Or as the Republicans call it, mine!
(LAUGHS)
I hope this is covered by your HMO.
I was covered once by an HMO
in San Francisco.
I Haight my Ashbury in these jeans.
Ding-ding, Rice-A-Roni.
Ah! You got all those references in there.
Of course, now everyone can afford
health care because of Obama.
Yeah, you want a Band-Aid?
No problem, turkey.
Come on down to Obama-Mart. The price
is free, but your ass better vote for me.
Ha! Political with a twist.
It's funny from the news.
What's going on in here?
You gotta check this out,
it's Robin Williams!
Ho-ho! A nurse is a nurse, of curse.
Up yours, Wilbur.
Oh, my God!
Everyone I touch turns into Robin Williams!
Yes! Peter "Sweet Cheeks" Griffin,
you have been given the power from God.
- Ho-ho! Ho-ho!
- Ho-ho!
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)
I will be so responsible with this.
- Thanks, guys.
- Ho-ho!
- Bye.
- See you, Peter.
- Y'all come back now, you hear?
- (CHUCKLES) It's Patch Adams Robin.
He cures stuff the fun way,
not the medicine way.
So, somehow the lightning gave your dad
the power to turn anyone I touch
into Robin Williams.
Good. I can ask him how he got his RV
stuck on the tip ofa mountain.
Peter, did Dr. Hartman say
how long this was gonna last?
There is no more Dr. Hartman, Lois.
He's Robin Williams now.
Bet you kids never thought
your dad would have superpowers, huh?
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)
- Peter!
- Ho-ho! You pat my back, I pat yours,
and Pat Robertson pats Mr. Happy.
(EXAGGERATED SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Yes! Praise Jesus with your Visa card.
Max it out on the Lord, people.
Oh, boy! And that's the second
Southern preacher one.
Look, Brian, Meg is one of the sensitive,
bearded Robin Williams characters.
- Ha!
- You think that's funny, chief?
- Well, I...
- My wife is dead.
- Oh, l'm sorry.
- She's dead, chief.
Ho-ho! Dead. The Grateful Dead.
Please do not take the brown acid.
It will turn you into a Martian.
Take me to your wiener.
- Ho-ho!
- We're fucked.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING)
He racks in the treetop all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birds an Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
- Rockin' robin, rock, rock
- Tweet, tweet, tweet
- Rockin' robin
- Tweet...
I don't know, Peter.
This all seems kind of creepy.
What do you mean? This is great!
Everyone's hilarious now.
What do you think, Quagmire?
What? I can't hear a thing over this noise.
- What?
- This is unbearable!
I think I got just the thing
to cheer you up, Joe.
I know I said I was a leg man,
but this is ridiculous. Ha!
I feel like a testicle on steroids.
- Honey, I shrunk my nuts. Ha!
- Ah!
Ho-ho! I'm a San Francisco pirate.
I Haight my Ashbury in these jeans.
A lot of the material is repeated.
Mmm!
Lois, your torso is so broad and solid.
(SPITS)
(COUGHS)
Ahhh! You're not Lois!
I can hear you. l'm not deaf.
I don't believe that's real sign language.
Brian, this is a disaster.
I turned everyone into Robin Williams.
- You gotta help me!
- (ELECTRICITY SURGING)
Yo, yo, yo, Peter G.
What's happening, dawg?
Oh! Sideways Hat Robin. Dear God, no!
(KETTLE WHISTLING)
(SING-SONG VOICE) Gonna have
some hot tea, baby, this morning.
(SCREAMS)
BOTH: Run, Forrest, run!
Ho-ho! Coffee? One Gump or two?
- Ho-ho!
- Ho-ho!
All right, Rupert, all we have to do
is act like Robin Williams,
and he'll think we've already changed.
Ho-ho! Scattered stream of references!
Lots of energy!
One good one for every 10. Ho-ho!
Damn these hands.
(EXAGGERATED KISS)
Well, I haven't been to temple in a while.
- Ahhh!
- (ELECTRICITY SURGES)
Ladies and gentleman, The Doors.
- (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
- Ahhh!
Ho-ho! Jogging! Running on empty.
- Ho-ho!
- Run, Forrest, run!
(TIRES SQUEALING)
Ho-ho! I'm a Mercedes.
(MOCK GERMAN ACCENT)
Und where are your papers?
Are you from East or West Berlin?
Well, I'm from West Berlin, pilgrim.
(SOBBING)
Shut up! (WAILING)
Stop riffing!
Jump, Forrest, jump!
Must be a leap year. Ho-ho!
Time to lose some weight, dearie.
No more comedy.
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Guys, will you please settle down?
Can we settle down, please?
Everyone. Everyone,
can I have your attention?
Oh, captains, my captains.
I have an announcement to make.
You are all free.
You have been fired from the school.
Vietnam is over. The hospital is closing.
Will Hunting is all better.
- It's not your fault.
- It's not your fault.
Shut up. Seriously, shut up.
Please, you are done here.
Go and spread your comedy
to all corners of this country.
Wait, not you five.
I'm gonna keep you for an experiment.
Ho-ho! Eggs.
Who came first,
the chicken or the porn star?
Ho-ho! The Porn Identity.
Who am I? Oh, yeah, the pizza man.
- (MIMICKING '80S PORN SOUNDTRACK)
- Ho-ho!
Peter, can you pass the coffee?
Sure, Brian the dog.
- Anything for my family.
- (INDISTINCT TALKING)
I guess Disney wouldn't let us
do the Aladdin one.
LOIS: Stewie, rise and shine.
Good morning, Stewie.
STEWIE: Fuck you.
You ready for the day, sweetie?
STEWIE: Ah, I smell you've had coffee
and nothing to eat.
(SNIFFING)
Oh, someone needs a diaper change.
STEWIE: Are you proud of yourself,
that this is what you do?
Is this a dime? Did you swallow a dime?
STEWIE: Yeah, wipe it off and put it back
in your purse, you white trash hen.
There we go. Who's my clean little boy?
(STEWIE GIGGLING)
STEWIE: Your roots are ridiculous.
I'm gonna grab your hair
'cause I like grabbing stuff.
Okay. Okay, Stewie, let go. Let go, Stewie.
Let go of Mommy's hair.
STEWIE:
When I grow up, I'm never gonna call you.
I'm gonna be busy with my job
and my family. You'll be nothing.
Stewie, I want you to have my ring.
It's one of my most important possessions,
and I want you to have it.
STEWIE: 
Okay, red flag. Red flag, everybody.
Hey, Stewie, wanna go down the slide?
STEWIE: Um...
What's the matter?
You never been down the slide before?
(STEWIE SCOFFING)
Yeah, like, a thousand times.
Just done it so much,
I'm bored with it, that's all.
All right, I guess we're doing this.
- Whoa.
- BOY: Come on down, Stewie!
(HAWKS SCREECHING)
STEWIE: This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.
All right, you can do this, Stewie.
Here we go.
Ahhh!
(THUD)
- Are you okay?
- STEWIE: Yeah, that wasn't so bad.
You might wanna move.
That farting Polish kid
is coming down the slide.
- (STEWIE GRUNTS)
- (FARTS)
STEWIE: (GROANING) Pavel!
QUAGMIRE: Hey, kid, come here.
I wanna see if I can still smell
your mom's boobs on your mouth.
STEWIE:
Why don't you go hump a pile of garbage?
All right, here we go. Classic.
- Uh-oh.
- (ENGINE STARTS)
Ow!
- (CAR BEEPING)
- Oh, God! Brian! Brian!
Guess I'm going for a ride.
- Why are we stopping?
- (CHATTERS)
Oh, come on.
(CHATTERING)
- (TIRES SCREECHING)
- For God's sake, Brian. lt's just a squirrel.
BRIAN: Yeah!
STEWIE: Oh, God!
Ugh!
He can't hurt you anymore.
Hey, there, little fella.
We sure got a lovely day for it, don't we?
STEWIE: 
Stay away from my brother's butt.
LOIS: Okay, Stewie,
let's get that little face washed off.
Then you can play
with your bath toys, huh?
STEWIE: 
No, I hate getting my face washed.
Oh, look, it's just Mr. Frog. Hello, Mr. Frog...
(CHOKING)
My God, how the hell
do I keep falling for that?
Now you play with your toys
and I'll go get you a nice, fluffy towel.
STEWIE: Stewart Griffin,
explorer, adventurer,
skin-diving international playboy.

(GROWLING PLAYFULLY)
"I'm swimming at night 'cause I'm a slut
and now l'm paying the price for it."
(PANTING)
PETER: Hey, Stewie.
Wow, looks like you got
some cool bath toys in there.
Is it okay if I join you?
STEWIE: No! Ahhh!
(STEWIE PANTING)
Hey, is that my froggie butt cloth?
Okay, Stewie, bedtime's in 10 minutes.
I'll be right back.
STEWIE: Hmm.
I think I have time for a quickie.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
(WHIRRING)
Excuse me, Mr. Cobain?
Look, I know you're depressed.
Made some bad choices with women,
but there's another way.
Haagen-Dazs, lots of Haagen-Dazs.
Well, let's see if it worked. Here we go.
Ha! You're still alive, you fat fuck.
Okay, Stewie, time for bed.
You want Mommy to read you
a night-night story?
Oh, how about this one?
(STEWIE READING TITLE)
(LOIS READING)
STEWIE: Who is this book for?
(LOIS READING)
STEWIE: Ugh, that was absolute garbage.
Read it again!
Hey, Lois. I'm home from the Clam.
You know what that means.
STEWIE: You spent the last 10 minutes
parked in front of the house,
crying in your car?
Not now, Peter.
I'm doing story time with Stewie.
STEWIE: 
 Yeah, scram, Drinky.
I got a story.
lt's about the little penis that could.
It thinks it can, it thinks...
In fact, it's pretty sure it can.
(STUTTERING) It's gonna.
STEWIE: Hey,
am I gonna have to handle this?
Do you want me to handle this?
Peter, just go wait in the bedroom.
I'll be right there.
Fine, but if I gotta pee first,
this night's gonna be ruined.
Ruined.
Good night, sweetie. Mommy loves you.
STEWIE: Yeah, you better get some rest.
You've gotta get the mail tomorrow.
(YAWNS)
(RHYTHMIC BANGING)
Huh?
(BANGING CONTINUES)
(GRUNTING)
It's big, isn't it?
Yes, Peter. It's very big.
Yeah, it's big.
Oh, God, yes!
(MOANS) Yes!
Yeah.
(BUZZING)
Oh, you're gonna use that thing, good.
I love you so much.
