(groaning softly)
Okay, who'd like to startus off with show-and-tell?
Stewie?
Yes, today I brought inmy mother's driver's license.
Now, if you look closely,she's clearly drunk.
You could put a Breathalyzer upto that photo,
and she'd get a DUI.
Ha-ha, Stewie's naked!
What?!
(laughter)
Oh, my God!Don't look! Don't look!
Cell phones down!Cell phones down!
(ominous music playing)
(shouts)What the deuce?!Stewie!
Run from the monster.
You might have to drive.
(groaning)
Thank you all so muchfor coming this evening
to my very fancy dinner party.
Oh, my God!I'm at Glenn Close's house!
You look very handsome tonight,Stewie.
Well, thank you.And you're the prettiest
of all the women I knowwhose name is Glenn.
Everyone,please finish your salads,
because our main course tonightis...
boiled rabbit.(laughing)
(laughter)
I-I don't... I don't get that.
It seems weird that I'd havea joke in my own dream
that I don't get.Oh, thank you so...
(shouts)
(groaning)
Quick, you'realmost on!
What? I'm on?
But I don't know anyof my lines!
(gasps)
&#9834; It seems today &#9834;
&#9834; That all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence inmovies and sex on TV &#9834;
PETER:&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;(mumbling gibberish)
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;(mumbling gibberish)
&#9834; Pumpkin pie &#9834;
What the hell? Puthim on the bench.
Wait, please, no!I just wasn't ready!
Don't worry.We'll put you in soon.
Ho-ho-ho!
Is funnybecause you won't be back!
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
(shouts)
Wait, how did Joe get halfway upthose stairs?
Lois, get in here!
It's dark and I'm frightened!
I think they've got this thingbackwards.
Hey, wake up!
I had a bad dream, so nowyour night has to be terrible.
Peter, Stewie's upset.
Scooch over so hecan sleep with us.
Oh, come on.Are you serious?
Last time, he kicked meall night.
And I got a big day tomorrow.I got two shows.
All right, folks,big treat for you today.
He's a little shy.
Put your hands togetherfor Sham-Peter!
I'm not shy! I'm angry!
I'm in constant pain!
This act has been condemnedby over 30 nations!
I'm gonna kill you all!
PETER: Ah, crap.I can't sleep like this.
And now my mind is racin'.
Like, how does that candlein Beauty and the Beast
sing so good?I mean, the teapot I get,
'cause she's a girl. Butthe candle, I don't under...
Oh, he's French. That's why.
(coughs)
(groans)
Couch it is, I guess.
Oh, my God. The couch is gone.
Where the hell is...Oh, that's right.
Couchella is this weekend.
(electronic music playing)
Hey, man,where you been?!
I just had sex witha girl on her period!
Dude, that's not a brag!
So, how fat are you?
240? Nice.
Oh, Peter! What areyou doing down here?
Oh, hey, Brian. Stewiekind of took over our bed,
so I'm lookingfor a place to sleep.
Well, why don't yougo up to the attic?
I think there's evena futon up there.
Huh. That's a great idea.
Geez, I'm glad you came along.
I'm gonna sleep betterthan a cartoon sheriff.
(snoring)
(click)
(twinkly toes sound effect)
(quietly): I was in jail 'causeI killed a bunch of old ladies.
And now that I'm out,I'm gonna do it again.
(light-hearted music cue)
Wow, Stewie,you look exhausted.
Yeah, 'cause I was up super latelast night, beefing your mom.
My mom's dead.Yeah, 'cause Ibeefed her to death.
Whoa, what's your problem?Why are you being such a jerk?
I'm sorry, Brian.I had the absolute worst night.
I had a weird dream.A frightening dream.
Yeah, Stewie,that's called a nightmare.
Sounds like you must've hadyour first one.
That's whata nightmare is?
I thought "nightmare" meant,like, being invited
to an apartment party.
Get a house if youwant to have a party.
I'm not going to aparty in an apartment.
Relax, it's no big deal.
People have nightmaresall the time.
Oh, no, Brian. I am not livingthrough that horror again.
In fact, I've decidedthat from this day forward,
I shall never allow myselfto fall asleep again.
Come on, that's ridiculous.
How do you thinkyou're gonna do that?
I don't know.Maybe I'll get a job
working the nightshift at a supermarket.
Hey, where'sthe vegetable aisle?
Yeah, right, it's 2:00 a.m.You're not here for vegetables.
(dejectedly):Well, I got the12 cucumbers.
What's wrong?Just this guy at the...
(sighs)Never mind.
Peter, we have a hamper.
Stop throwing your dirty clothesin the toilet.
Peter?
Peter, where are you?
(video game sound effects)
What's all this?
Oh, hey, Lois.Welcome to the Pete Pad,
where the dancing's hot,the drinks are hot...
Everything'sjust freakin' hot.
What have youdone to the attic?
Well, when I slept up herethe other night,
I realizedwhat a great space it is.
So I dragged up some stuff andturned it into a sweet hangout.
Even made it extra awesomeby stealing a real street sign.
(children giggling in distance)
(tires screech, thudding)(children scream)
I don't understand. Whatare you gonna do up here?
Eh, mostly just burn the roofof my mouth
on unevenly-heatedmicrowave burritos.
Now I'm busy, so close the floorand get out of here.
All right, all right,come on, Stewie.
You've got to stay awake.I know what'll help.
I'll watch that preview channel
that always hasinconsistent volumes.
ANNOUNCER:They're mother and daughterbut also best friends.
Catch Gilmore Girlson Channel 367.
ANNOUNCER 2 (loudly, blown-out):You can name your own pricefor hotel rooms!
(water gurgling)
(exhales)Help! Please!
(grunts)Damn it! Why can't I move?!
(rattling)
(growling)
Aah!
Stewie, you okay?What happened?
I was just sitting hereon the couch and I had
another nightmareabout that horrible monster.
Okay, that's it.
I'm gonna help you get thesenightmares under control.
Really?Oh, thank you, Brian.
And maybe I can help youcontrol your strange obsession
with eatingpencil erasers.
It's not an obsession.
Mmm, mmm, oh, yeah.
Oh, so rubbery. Mmm.
It's like a littlesteak. Mmm, mmm.
Brian, you really should...
The world is small andsafe when I do this!
Okay, Stewie, I read the reviewof a dream book on Amazon,
so I think I can help you.
Literally every other tabis open to Lusty Matures.
Yup, that's whatit takes now.
Anyway, it says herethat most nightmares
are born ofsubconscious fears.
So maybe if we makea list of the things
you're most afraid of,we can face and conquer
these fears together, andthen your nightmares'll end.
Huh, that's actuallya good idea.
Like the U.S. Army Reserves.
(explosion)
We're completely surrounded.We need reinforcements.
You know who couldreally bail us out?
Somebody who works five daysa week at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
These new digs of yoursare pretty great, Peter.
Hey, I broughtconstruction paper and markers
in case you guyswant to draw breasts.
Cool. But before that, who's upfor another insulation fight?
I'm in.Heck yeah.
(giggling)
Ha!(giggling)
Gotcha!
Missed me.
Sneak attack!
(all giggling)
(coughing)
What are youdoing up here?
I need you to takethe trash out.
You know what?I'm gonna use this
Peter Doesn't Have to Take Outthe Trash coupon
that I got for my anniversary.
You gave that to yourself.
I don't know,it says "official."
Oh, forget it,I'll do it myself.
This whole atticbusiness is ridiculous.
Hey, guys, check it out.
I'm a lady.
Joe...
you hit a home run withthat, I want to try it.
All right, Stewie,time to tackle your fears.
Now, it sounds likeyou're scared of monsters.
So to help you get over it,here's Frankenstein.
(growls)I'm Frankenstein.
I'm actually really nice.
There's no needto be scared of me. (growls)
Seriously?
This is obviouslyChris in a costume.
Huh. Well, thatcan't be possible.
Because here comes Chriswalking in the door right now.
Hey, hey, hey.Here comes Chris Griffin,
a-roodly-toot-toot.
Yeah, okay,whatever, Meg.
Meg?
You must betalking about me,
a-roodly-toot-toot.
Do they all say"a-roodly-toot-toot"?
A lot of them, yeah.
Chris, I'm puttingtogether a load of laundry.
You got anything?
(muffled cheering)
Damn it, Peter.
Are you guys playing lawn dartsin the attic again?
PETER:No.
Yay, lawn darts!
Peter wins lawn darts.
She's dumb.She got no idea.
(sighs)
(laughing)
All right, Peter,that's enough.
It is time toget out of...
What the hell?
Oh, yeah, we put Joein Stewie's old Jolly Jumper.
You told me this wasa paratrooper's harness.
Shut up, baby man.
That's it. Thisis our home,
not some frat house foryou and your friends.
Now, I want you outof this attic now.
No way, we ain't leaving.
We're havingtoo much fun up here.
Quagmire just showed ushis Eric McCormack impression.
There could beno such thing.
Well, that's what I said,but then he did it,
and I was like, "Oh, all right,okay, yeah, kind of."
Fine. You like thedamn attic so much?
Then enjoy the attic!
(electric whirring)
Did... did she justlock us in here?
It looks like it.
Guys, spin me back.I didn't see what happened.
So, how'd it go last night?Did we cure your nightmares?
No, not at all. Theywere worse than ever.
Which is why I built this.
&#9834; &#9834;
What the hell is that?
It's a Digital Dream Interface.
You see, once connectedto this device,
you will be able to entermy sleeping mind, where
you will end these horribledreams once and for all.
I'm gonna do what?
(babbles)
What... what-whatdoes he want?
What is he saying?
I think he's saying"a-roodly-toot-toot".
We just can't understand himbecause of the way he talks.
(babbles)
Oh, no, no, I thinkhe just needs a ride home.
Stewie, you can't be serious.
Oh, I'm very serious.
You and I will place thesecranial impulse receptor caps
on our heads, I shallbegin my slumber, and...
And then this thingwill actually allow me
to enter your dream?
That's right, Brian.
I want you to come insideme while I'm asleep.
Do-Don't... don'tsay it like that.
And once you're in mydream, your job is to stop
these nightmares by findingthat monster and killing him.
This isn't a jobfor the meek, Brian.
When you get in there,you've got to be hard.
Okay, but thatfelt intentional.
All right,let's get to it.
This is your receptor cap.
Over here is your REM monitor.
What's this thing do?
Oh, that's just a littlebike bell for fun.
(rings)I found it at the crosswalk
where those kidsgot creamed the other day.
Anyway, let's get started.
&#9834; &#9834;
Hello? Stewie?
&#9834; &#9834;
Ah, you must beBrian. I'm Glenn.
Yes, I know. You werevery mean in 101 Dalmations.
Thank you. Would you liketo do the Bristol Stomp?
&#9834; The kids in Bristolare sharp as a pistol &#9834;
&#9834; When they dothe Bristol Stomp &#9834;
How does he even know this?&#9834; Really somethin' whenthey join in jumpin' &#9834;
He heard it once in the car.&#9834; When they dothe Bristol... &#9834;
Geez, Loisis really serious.
I can't believeshe left us up here all night.
Damn it, we got to do something.
Maybe if we just scream for helpsomeone'll hear us.
Help! Help! Help!
MAN: In case of a bear attack,you should
A, lie down,
B, run downhill,
or C, stand your ground?
&#9834; &#9834;
(whooshing)
...and just becauseof the roles I play,
people always assumeI'm very serious in real life.
Yeah, I could see that.But I'm not.
I'm very capableof being silly, too.
See, watch, I'll show you.
Fart.
I, uh... Did-did...did you just say "fart"?
Yes, that's mebeing rather silly.
Well, hello, Brian.
I say, whatbrings you here?
Stewie, hey! I'm hereto find and kill the monster
that's been causingall your nightmares.
Oh, that soundswonderful! Let's do it!
Oh, but real quick,
I'm just gonna turninto Elmo for a second.
Hi, Brian!
Elmo speak bad Englishon educational show!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Okay, I'm back.Let's go.
This way to thesubconscious.
(whooshing)
(liquid gurgling)
(Muzak playing)
Oh, this seemsrather pleasant.Yeah.
Hey, you know, that Glenn Closesalad actually wasn't bad.
Yeah, a lot of my dreamshave pretty good salad.
Oh, no.What?! Where are we?!
We're at the doctor!
Time for a baby shotin your fanny!
(yelling)
(both yell)
(yelling)
(flames whoosh, yelling)
(laughing)
(yelling)
Come give Grandpa a sloppy,old-man, coffee kiss!
(yelling)
(high-pitched shooting)
Would you like some candy?
Help me find my lost puppy?
I like your mouth and butt.
(yelling)
What the hell was that?!
Lois has painted a verydark picture of abduction.
(both grunt)
Adult stuff,adult stuff, adult stuff.
The world is scary,adult stuff, adult stuff.
Scary people yelling in anotherpart of the world, adult stuff.
(screams)
I wish Mom wouldn't watchthe news in front of me!
Coming up: a map witha hurricane on it.
(in deep voice):And you don't knowyour states yet!
(upbeat banjo music playing)
Aah! That one trip to thepetting zoo really messed me up!
I saw too much!
(whoosh)
(yelling)
(whoosh)
(clacking)
(grunts)
Stewie, look!
(growls)
(gasps)It's the monster!
Quick, Brian!Kill it!
Oh, there you guys are.
I would've been here sooner,
but one of my legs is a snakethat's very hungry for mice.
(mouse squeaking)
(magical chime)
(mouse squeaking)
(hissing)
(grunts)
(air whipping)
(yells, growling)
(growling)
(yelling)
(groaning)
Nice shot.Get it? Shot?
All right, bye!
(mice squeaking)
You did it, Brian!
You killedthe monster!
(hissing)
(gasps)What the hell?!
It's me!
Oh, my God,you're right!
But I... I don't understand.
Why am I the sourceof your fears?
Huh. I'mnot sure.
Maybe this meansthat deep down,
the thing I'm most afraidof is disappointing you.
Me? Wh-Why do you care so muchabout what I think?
Well, think about it.
You've been more of afather figure to me
than the fat man everhas been or ever will be.
Look, I knowI'm always busting your balls,
but it's just because you'rethe only person in this house
whose judgmentactually matters to me.
Wow. Thanks, Stewie.
But listen, you-you never haveto worry about letting me down.
I'll always be proud of you.
In fact, I already am.
You are?
'Course I am.
I mean, you're only a baby,and yet,
you're one of the mostamazing people I know.
Well, thank you, Brian.
Well, Stewie, seems likemy work here is done.
What's the best wayout of here?
Oh, yeah, no, thatone stays locked
until the overnight to Vegas
with my collegea cappella group.
Peter, I'm goingcrazy up here.
We all are!
You got to talk to Lois!
Damn it, you're right.
Lois, let us out of here!
No way! You like it so much?!
Then you can rot up therewith your buddies!
Lois, so help me God,
if you don't let us outright this second,
I'm gonna take a dumpon your wedding dress!
You wouldn't dare!
Don't test me. I'll do it!We'll all do it!
Quagmire, pull downyour pants!
QUAGMIRE:What?! I'm not doing that!
You leave my dress alone, Peter!
CLEVELAND:If it'll get us out of here,I'll make a doodie on it.
QUAGMIRE:What, are you nuts?!
CLEVELAND:I've been crowningfor six hours!
PETER:Cleveland's pants are off, Lois!
Here come mine!This is happening!
QUAGMIRE:Lois, they're not bluffing!Open the door!
JOE:I miss Bonnie!
Damn it, Peter,you hold that in!
I know you can!
You did it on the ferryto Block Island!
QUAGMIRE:Oh, my God, I'm gonna puke!
PETER:That's good! Puke on the dress!Puke on the dress!
Aah, damn it!
MAN (over headphones):Not all snake bites are lethal.
(grunts)
(all yelling)
There! You happy?!
You were too late.We pooed on the gown.
Ripped a big holein your ceiling, too.
I barfed on Peter's ass.
I-I don't know if it goton the dress or not, Lois,
but I-I am... I am so sorry.
Yeah, this was alla huge disaster.
Let's just agree that we bothwent a bit too far, hmm?
I, uh... I might...
I might need two weeks offfrom this friendship.
Stewie, you awake?
Did you have any nightmares?
I don't think so.
(gasps)Did you get rid of the monster?
Sure did. Turned outthat monster was nothing more
than a manifestation
of your subconscious desirenot to disappoint me.
Apparently, I'm likea father figure to you.
Okay. Wow. Somebody'sgot a big head.
Stewie, I want you to know...I'm very proud of you.
All right, that's...that's awkward.
How-how am I supposedto respond to that?
You are a good person.Stop complimenting me.
"Oh, I sure hope the dogapproves of who I am."
I'm out of here, weirdo.
There's a wedding dress out herecovered in (bleep).
