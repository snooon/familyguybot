&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Oh, I love shoppingat Christmastime.
Ugh, mall food courtsare so depressing.
You can always tellwhich fathers are disappointed
in their sons because they eatlunch with their coats still on.
How's that food,dum-dum?
Too bad eatingain't math,
'cause then I'd have somethingto be proud of.
I want to golive with Mom.
I know. So do I.
Welcome toTommy Bahama.
Yeah, you got anythingfor a poor fat person
who wants to looklike a rich fat person?
Of course.
Now, I'll mostly behitting on waitresses
who are too young and thinto ever be interested in me.
Hitting on them in akindly, genial way?
No, in a threatening,creepy,
I'm-joking-but-I'm-not-really-joking way.
Y-You have anythingfor that?
Sir, what you're describing isprecisely Mr. Bahama's vision.
ANNOUNCER: Tommy Bahama-- fivemillion uncles can't be wrong.
Hey, sorry to bother you,but would you like to work here?
Me?Yeah, you'd be perfect.
All right, now let me just takeoff these security tags for you.
It's a living.
(Flintstones transitionmusic plays)
So random!
That's a comment on us.
Hey, check that out.
Oh, wow. This is awesome!
You know Jeff Garlin hasone of these in his house.
Ah, I love this chair.
Dog in a Jets jersey,get in here!
God, I have the best basement.
Peter, this chaircosts $3,000.
That's not somuch, Lois.
It's only infinity times whatyou bring home every week.
Peter, look over there.
Is that...is that Jesus?
Whoa, yeah, wow.
It's been a whilesince we've seen him.
Hey, Jesus!
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, buddy.What are you doing in Quahog?
Actually,I never left.
Really?Why didn't you call us?
Well, I felt kind of badabout how we left things.
I wasn't sure you'dwant to hear from me.
Oh, that's silly.
We could neverstay mad at you.
Yeah, I've never been oneto hold grudges.
I even forgave the manwho murdered my son.
And although I will neverget over the pain
of what you did to my son,I forgive you,
because I believe you are sickand in need of help.
Mr. Griffin, this isthe Office of City Planning.
You requested a variance tobuild a hot tub off your garage.
Oh, yeah.Did I get it?
No.
I will kill your son!
Your son is dead!
I'm so glad there'sno hard feelings.
Listen, Peter, weshould catch up.
Why don't you come over to myplace for a beer or something?
Aw, that sounds great!
Hey, you want meto pick anything up
on the way overor no, you're good?
Oh, uh...
I-I guess we could maybejust order something.
Yeah, I don't have any cash,but we'll figure it out.
Hey, Peter.Come on in.
Mi casa es, uh...
I-I don't know Spanish.
Huh, I think half the worldwould be surprised to know that.
Hey, nice place here.
This is not too... too...
it's not... it's not too...not too good.
Yeah, I know it'snothing fancy,
but, you know, I'm not reallyinto material possessions.
Geez, this placeis depressing.
Hey, how come you aren'twith your family
during Christmas, anyway?
I can't deal with my familyduring the holidays.
And besides, my dadalways spends Christmas
at his time-share in CoralGables with his girlfriend.
Great, here comes that couplewith the adult disabled kid.
Hey, can we join you?
I-I'm Ken, this is Pam,and this right here is Scott.
We really want to thankyou, God, for testing us.
It's been sucha blessing.
Can't wait to see whatthat "bigger plan" is.
Well, I can'ttell you that.
But the good news is,
this little guy'sgonna make it to 74.
Oh, look, Jesus, you shouldn'tbe alone during Christmas.
And if I remembercorrectly,
isn't your birthdaysometime soon, too?
Ah, whatever,I'm fine.
I'll probably just reheat someramen and watch Grey's Anatomy.
No way. I'm not gonnalet my pal Jesus
spend his birthday like that.
Hey, you know what?
I am throwing youthe best birthday party ever.
Are you sureabout that?
Yeah, I'm greatat throwing parties.
I was in chargeof planning Woodstock.
All right, guys, here'swhat I'm thinking--
a whole festivalof muddy boobs.
Well, don't you wantto have music?
Oh, yeah.
That's a good way to getthose muddy boobs moving.
All right, you guys, Jesus'sbirthday party is gonna be epic.
Hey, since it'salso Christmas,
maybe we could make it,like, a Christmas theme.
What aboutSecret Santa?
That's always fun.
Okay, but five dollar limit.
Why don't wejust say no gifts?
Come on, guys, we don't have tomake such a big thing about it.
It's not like I'm a womanwho's about to turn 30.
You guys, I don't carewhat we do for my birthday,
as long as it laststhe whole week
and is very expensive andinconvenient for all my friends.
Oh, and I'm gonnadress like a slut
and be rude to everyonefor no reason.
But, Maya...
I don't care thatyour dad's dying,
we're all going toMontreal for the week.
Wait, wait, hold on.
If we're planning a party,
we haven't even talked aboutthe most important thing.
A hydration plan forpeople who overheat?
It could be as simpleas an ice bath.
No, no, I'm talkingabout women.
Oh, yeah, we definitely needsome women there.
Jesus, what kindof girls do you like?
Women?
Uh, all types,I guess.
"All types"?
Come on, Jesus.
Even Martin Lawrence when heused to dress up like Shenehneh?
CLEVELAND:(laughs) Shenehneh!
No, you knowwhat I mean.
Uh, like, uh,hot ladies.
Horny ones whosex on you.
What?
Yeah, you know.
They come back to your houseand sit on your... butt.
Wait a minute.
Jesus, have you everbeen with a woman?
Are you...are you a virgin?
(sighs)Yeah, I am.
How the helldoes that happen?
Well, in high school, my bestfriend was this hot prostitute,
and I just kind of gotinto the friend zone.
She's all like,"Oh, there's all these guys
having sex with me for money."
And I'm all like,"Oh, you deserve better."
And then I died.
Well, sex isoverrated.
Stay outof this, Joe.
All right, look,forget the party.
We got a moreimportant mission now.
Your 2,000-year-long cold streakis about to come to an end.
What do you mean?
I'm saying, Jesus, we are gonnahelp you lose your virginity.
(squeals)
God, I love sex!
All right, me andthe guys are off
to help Jesus losehis virginity.
Just put it in the ovenfor half an hour at 350.
What?I don't know.
That's what youalways say
when you leavethe house.
Oh, Peter,just be careful.
Losing your virginityis a big deal.
I'm sure Jesus doesn't wantsome gross quickie.
No, no, no, it's gonnabe nothing like that.
Just some random slutto maul in a bar
back where thepayphones used to be.
Peter, that'swhat I'm talking about.
You're makingthis whole thing crude.
It's his first time.
You need to bemore sensitive.
Don't worry, Lois.
I swear, I'll besensitive and gentle.
Like the Tasmanian Deviltucking in his kids.
(soothing Tasmanian Devilgibbering)
(gibbering)
All right, Jesus,
these speed date nightsare the best way
to meet a lot of chicks fast.
Now go get 'em.
So, wheredo you live?
Everywhere, all places.
Hopefully, inside you.
(buzzer sounds)
This is kind ofembarrassing,
but are you okaywith someone who smokes?
Oh, yeah.
A-Are you okay with someonewho wanders the desert,
lecturing peopleon how to act?
(buzzer sounds)
So, are you havinga good Friday?
Oh, is that supposedto be funny?
Shut your mouth, bitch.
(buzzer sounds)
How's the wine?It's terrific.
That's my blood,you know.
(buzzer sounds)
Where are you from?Israel.
(buzzer sounds)
All right, Jesus,
nowadays, everything is doneon the Internet.
All right? So, we gotto get you on Facebook.
Uhp, let me just closea couple of these windows.
There we go.
Sorry, I was up late last night.(chuckles)
Had the house to myself.
Sorry. Sorry.
Lot of POV stuff.
Yeah, I like to pretendit's mine down there
what's doing all the slapping.
Peter, how oldis that girl?
Excuse me, won't you?
Arr... lot of scumbagsout today.
Well, no luck gettingJesus laid yet.
I don't get it.
Jewish guys are supposedto be swimming in tail.
Peter, Jesus is never gonna finda woman going about it your way.
I think it's time I hada little talk with him
so he knows whata woman really wants.
All right,knock yourself out.
Don't look! Don't look!Don't look!
Jesus, I asked youto lunch
because I think you'vebeen getting bad advice
about findinga special someone.
Well, Peter's beendoing his best,
but lately he seems morefocused on marketing
his eroticAdvent calendar.
All right, kids, let's seewhat's under Christmas...
Ugh, another puckered anus.
Look, Jesus,
just forget whateverPeter's been telling you.
You just haveto be yourself
and let a sweet girlsee that side of you.
Well, you're easy to talk to.
I just get all tongue-tiedwith other girls.
Plus, being myselfisn't that impressive.
What do you mean?
You're sensitive,
you died for our sinsand ascended into Heaven,
and you got nice skin.
Don't be afraidto be honest with a girl
and show her who you are.
Wow, thanks, Lois.
That's the second best adviceanyone's ever given me.
I don't know, man.
Jesus Hitler Christsounds weird.
So just go with "H"?Yeah.
All right, guys,let's not get discouraged, okay?
We just got to be more creativeabout getting Jesus laid.
I just tell folks to go downto the Happy Handy Smile Massage
and get it over with.
I sometimes go down there,
and when they tell meI'm done, I leave.
Hey, guys. Uh, Peter,
can I talk to youfor a sec?Sure.
Peter, listen.
I've found the woman who I'dlike to lose my virginity to.
It's someonewho understands me
and someone I feelvery close to.
Oh, wow.Jesus, that's great!
Hey, is itCarrie Underwood?
Somebody told me youguys went out once.
Yeah, we did.But it was a disaster.
Jesus, take the wheel.
What?
I want to killthese (bleep) cops!
(siren wailing)
Actually, Peter, I wantmy first time to be with...
Lois.
Lois, my partnerat the law firm?
No, Peter. It's your Lois.
Lois Griffin.
What?! I am outraged!
But probably not as outraged
as the ten millionChristians watching.
Please writeto this address quickly.
Maybe we can both stopthese Hollywood Jew writers
from wrecking my marriageand your religion.
You want to lose yourvirginity to Lois?!
No way!
Look, Peter, I knowit's a lot to ask.
But if it wasn't okay,I wouldn't suggest it.
Well, you makea good point.
But this is my wifeyou're talking about!
Please, Peter?
I just know Lois wouldmake my first experience
as special and memorableas it should be.
Plus, I can make itworth your while.
After all, I'm Jesus.
I could give youanything you want.
Anything?
Like... like anythingin the universe?
Absolutely.
Brookstone massage chair.
Really?
Are-are you sure?
Yup. Never been more sureof anything in my life.
Well, except one thing.
Good evening, sir.
Would you like tohear our specials?
No! Pizza!
Let me getthis straight.
You want me to havesex with another man?
Oh, not just any man, Lois.
This is Jesuswe're talking about.
He's a savior.
He could even saveour marriage.
Why? What's wrongwith our marriage?
"What's wrongwith our marriage?"
You're sitting around, talkingabout sleeping with other guys!
Peter, this wasyour idea!
Lois, let's not playthe blame game.
Clearly, there's been a lotof cheating on both sides,
but the point iswhere do we go from here?
Huh, I don't know.
Sleeping with Jesusjust feels wrong.
Doesn't the Bible say not tocovet thy neighbor's wife?
Oh, come on, Lois,the Bible's
just a bunchof general guidelines.
None of the commandmentsare written in stone.
You're reallyokay with this?
Of course.
Look, there really isno downside to this.
It's one of those things thatseems bad, but really is good.
Like that fracking companywe let drill in the backyard.
Well, I guessit is kind of an honor
that out of all the peoplein the world, Jesus chose me.
I mean, he could've had anyone.
Elizabeth Perkins, PatriciaRichardson, Katey Sagal...
Yeah! I-I mean, maybe not them,but somebody else.
And-and the Son of God'sfirst time should be special.
Even divine.
Maybe I'd actually bedoing a good thing.
You sure aboutthis, Peter?
You bet.
As sure as I waswhen I created Lady Gaga.
All right, listen, fella,your game is confusion.
Zip! Zam! Zoop!
Nobody gets a straightlook at nothing!
Boy, this must bekilling you.
You're an atheist,
and the one guyyou don't believe in
is getting to bangthe woman of your dreams.
You know what? I don't haveto sit here and take this.
I'm out of here.
Can-can you let me outside?
(doorbell rings)
Hi, Peter.
Well, hello, young man.
Don't you look nice?
She's almost ready.
&#9834; There she goes &#9834;
&#9834; There she goes again &#9834;
&#9834; Pulsing through my veins &#9834;
&#9834; And I just can't contain... &#9834;
I'm sorry, I was justcoming down the stairs
at the same time.
Wow, Mom.You look beautiful.
Well, we know he's circumcised,
so she won't have to dealwith that nonsense.
Oh, and don't worryabout not hitting bottom.
I've only grazed it once andthat was with a running start.
Hey, Jerome, give meanother Pawtucket Pat.
I'll take it over hereon my Brookstone massage chair.
That's a nicechair, Peter.
Hey, do you think if I letJesus sleep with Bonnie,
he'd give me backthe use of my legs?
Joe, I don't speak for Jesus.I just get him trim.
Now to take this thingout for a spin.
(chair vibrating)
(sighs)
(birds squawking)
Ah, time for a relaxing,sponsored daydream.
Oh, Jesus!
Jesus! Jesus!
(screams)
God, I lovemassage chairs.
Are you in one, too?
Yes, but it's horrible!
It was bought for me by Jesus,but now he's doing my wife!
Oh. I'm just tryingmine out in the store.
Guys! I think I might'vemade a terrible mistake
with this wholeLois and Jesus thing!
I don't blame you, Peter.
I always thought it wassort of a strange choice
to let Jesus haverelations with your wife.
I'm sorry, did you say Jesusis sleeping with your wife?
Great, now everybody knows
my wife is takingJesus's virginity.
Listen, pal,Jesus ain't no virgin.
He did the same thingto me last Christmas.
He what?!
Yeah, Jesus didthe same thing
to my wifeChristmas before last
and my buddy's wifethe year before that.
What the hell?
But he's so lonely.
Nah, he just acts lonelyand lies about being a virgin
so he can get with guys' wives.
Did he show youthat sad little apartment?
He doesn't really live there.
He just uses it to store arthe bought on cruises.
Oh, my God, what have I done?!
Peter, maybe there's still time!Maybe you can stop them!
Where are they?
They're at the Barrington Hotel!Let's go, guys!
I just ordered nachos,but good luck, Peter.
Now for a slippy, no-boots runthrough the snow to my car.
(gasping)
(screams) Aw, crap!
I just pulleda thousand muscles!
(grunting)
(screams)
(grunting)
Ow! That was a loud crack!
Ah, yeah, that was all bone!
Oh! Aw! Son of a whore!
Oh, this is bad.This is real bad.
I'm not gonna goto the doctor though.
(ignition sputters)
Damn it!
(tires screech)
Get out!I need this car!
What are you, a cop?
No! Jesus is about tohave sex with my wife!
Oh, then here! Take it!
Get out!I need this car!
So do I!
Jesus Christ is aboutto have sex with my wife!
Lenny Kravitz is aboutto have sex with my daughter!
Oh! Oh, my God!
Here, take the car!Take the car!
Get out of here!What are you doing?!
Go, go, go!
Hey, kid, I needthat toboggan!
Jesus Christ is gonnahave sex with my wife!
Um, okay.
And I needyour little hat.
And those Spider-Man mittens--I'll need those, too.
And what's inyour pockets?
A rabbit's foot, a penknife,a bottle cap, a compass...
All of it, all of it.
(car horn blares)
Aw, crap. I'm out of hill.
You there! Boy!
What does that sign say?
I ain't muchfor book reading, sir.
But I seen our Lord and Saviorbring a lady in there
for a Christmas rodgering,I did.
You're a good boy.
Here's a goose.
(goose honks)
What room is Jesus in?
What room isLenny Kravitz in?
Aw, you were coming here, too?We could've carpooled.
(elevator bell dings)
Lois! Lois!
You son of a bitch!
What have you doneto my marriage?!
Peter?
Lois, don't do this!
I think I had, like,a Christmas miracle.
I realized I don'twant other people
humping my wifefor a chair.
It's okay, Peter.
Nothing happened.
It didn't?
No, I couldn'tsleep with him.
Not that I wasn't tempted.
He put actual strawberriesin a glass of champagne,
which was about the classiest,sexiest thing I'd ever seen.
But...
I couldn't go through with it.
Our marriage istoo important to me.
I love you, Lois.
I don't know whatI was thinking.
But you!You're a liar, Jesus!
Bravo, Peter, Lois.
Seems like you folks learnedthe lesson I intended.
What lesson?
Oh, you know, uh...
that, uh, this holiestof days is about,
uh, appreciating...
our loved ones and, uh,resisting... temptation.
Oh, so it was a test.
Like when your father toldAbraham to sacrifice Isaac?
Yes! That!
That's exactly right!
Uh, well, I can seemy work here is done.
Well taught, Jesus.Well taught.
Yeah, I guess.Who cares?
I'm not even real.Merry Christmas.
Well, Lois, I'm sure glad
you didn't have sexwith the Messiah.
Me, too, Peter.
Now let's openyour presents, kids.
Oh, Rupert, you'resuch a sneak.
I wonder what it is.
Oh. A Joni Mitchell CD.
"To continue youremotional education."
That's great.(chuckles)
That's really great.
Could you excuse mefor just one moment?
&#9834; I've looked at cloudsfrom both sides now... &#9834;
Who did he buythe necklace for?
I'm gonna let that teddy beargo all the way. </div>\t'
