&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Aw, man, I've been dyingto see Maniac Pope 2.
The first onewas awesome.
Is this one ofthose theaters
where they bring your beef stewright to your seat?
What? That'snot a thing.
Sure is.
Don't get mad at me 'causeyou don't know nothing fancy.
I feel like I'mbeing watched.
Of courseyou are, silly.
The Lord is alwayswatching us.
(suspenseful music playing)
May the swordbe with you.
(gasps)
And also with you!
Geez, this movie sucks.
I know,it's terrible.
(whispering): Excuse me,who had the stroganoff
with the roastedpotatoes?
CLEVELAND:Right here.
Thank you for seeing me,Your Excellency.
Of course.
What did you say yourname was, my child?
Lucy.
You've been "Lucified."
That was awful.
I know. They just redidall the same stuff
from the first Maniac Pope.
Yeah, like in the firstManiac Pope,
he says to Bruce,"You've been Brucified."
Like, that's smart,right?
That's a smart line.
But he did the same thingtwice in this movie.
Once to Lucy and once earlierwhen he found that wild goose.
It's justbad writing.
Yeah, I mean, we could writea better horror movie than that.
Really? Youthink we could?
Absolutely. I'm as creative asthe first spider to spin a web.
Hey, you know howwe always dreamed
about having a housethat comes out of our butts?
Uh, what?
Eh?
Yeah. Butt-house.
I found your cigarettes.
That's all I'm gonna say.
Morning, everybody.
And the crisiscontinues.
(chuckling):What, these?
Come on.
Last thing I wantis attention.
It's just that when you'veread as many books as I have,
it-it takes a toll,you know?
You sure it's notfrom watching
too much close-upporn on your phone?
(chuckling): You know,I wouldn't be surprised
if they have that now.
Brian, what do youwant for breakfast?
Uh, hold on.
What do I want?
You're so full of it.You don't need those things.
Wait, who said that?
Oh, Stewie.
You are just horrible.
You're even worsethan those people
who take dumpsin the shower.
What?
W-Why are you cutting to me?
What did somebody say?
Whatever they said I do,I don't do.
All right, I got ahorror movie idea.
It's calledCereal Killer.
A serial killer who onlykills people who eat cereal.
Wait, what... what if Godis a serial killer?
He lowers the average lifespanof humans to 65,
but there are many exceptionsbased on genetics and diet.
That's stupid-- I ain't neverheard of somebody lived to 65.
Look, I think the problem isthis is a bar.
We can't get inspired here.
We have to go someplacescary, you know?
To put us in the mood.
I got it: the old Quahog Asylum.
What?! We can't go there.
That place has beenabandoned for years.
And they say it's hauntedby a ghost with a hook-hand.
That's why it'sthe perfect place.
If we want to writea scary movie,
we need to do itsomewhere scary.
Well, I guesswe could try it.
We have sort of just beenspinning our wheels here.
No offense, Joe.
(sighs) I guessCleveland's right.
So far, this has beena bigger waste of time
than an acceptance speechat the Asperger's Awards.
I'd like to thankeveryone I've ever met,
in the order that I met them,last name first,
and if anyone interrupts me,I'll have to start over.
(thunder crashes)
&#9834; &#9834;
(thunder crashes)
This placeis terrible.
Are you kidding?
It's the perfect placeto write a horror movie.
All right, well, I got an idea.
You know, I likethem horror movies
where you got a coupleof teenagers getting busy
in their car at Makeout Point,
but there's a killeron the loose.
Hey, Stacy, what do you saywe go all the way tonight?
And then I unloadon the sun visors.
Is that allyou ever think about?
And besides, Richie,aren't you worried
about what the man on the radiois saying right now?
TOM TUCKER:Another dead teenage couplewas found at Makeout Point,
clawed beyond recognition.
You see?
There's a dangerouscreature out there.
Oh, what, you mean thebig, rabid, slobbery cat
what's been scratchingpeople to death?
I don't believeit exists, Stacy.
Now, help me get the rightangle and lower the visor.
(cat yowls in distance)
Richie,did you hear that?
Will you calm down?
We're the onlyones out here...
(screams)
Rrrawwwr!
(screaming)
(screams)
Oh, my God!
(screaming)
(screaming)
(screaming)
(roars)
Wait, you were the guyand the cat?
And what's withthat visor stuff?
Did Richie achieverelease?
Okay, of the three of you,
Cleveland's the only onewho gets it.
That's an awful idea.Well, I got one.
We should write one of themzombie movies
where a guy wakes up in acomfortable cotton hospital gown
with the back open so there'sa nice breeze on your behind,
and he's like, "This ain't bad."
But then he noticesthe hospital's empty!
Nurse, I'm readyfor my sponge bath.
Hmm.
What happened to this place?
Everybody up and gone.
(electrical crackling)
Hmm, that's annoying.
(static hissing)
Maybe it's a loose filament.
(rattling)
Nope, that's a busted bulb.
These are all 145s.
I need a 180.
Well, now, maybe I didneed a 145.
There we go.
(pops)
Damn it, I guessit's a wiring issue.
That's it?
What the hell? When dothe zombies show up?
That's the thing.
Their shuttle was late.
I-I don't know,I-I was thinking
we'd write a moviewhere something
that's not supposedto be scary becomes scary.
Like an evil doll.
Yeah, or-or like anevil bar of soap.
Peter, I don't thinkthat's such a good id...Too late!
Oh, yeah, that's nice.
Time to wash my bodywith this harmless bar of soap.
(dramatic music plays)
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa,
are you enjoyingthat new soap I bought you
from that mysterious Chinese man
whose store was weirdlynot there the next day?
Ambassador Mumbasa?
Oh, my God, Ambassador Mumbasa!
(dramatic music plays)
(screams)
Ambassador Mumbasa?
Assistant Ambassador Armstrong?
Everything okay up therewith the bath?
(screams)
(gasps)
I wonder if everything's okayup at the old embassy.
(wind howling, door slams)
All right, maybe coming herewasn't such a great idea.
Is anybody else gettinga little freaked out
by all thesescary stories?
Yeah, even myspine is tingling.
You guys, I'm scared.
You remember that movieThe Blob?
What if the Blob?
Let's get out of here!
Aw, damn it, it's locked!
Oh, my God, somebodymust have locked us in.
We're gonnadie in here!
(high-pitched scream)
Sorry, guys,somebody e-mailed me a video
of a sheep screaming.
(high-pitched scream)
It was him.It was the hook-handed killer.
He locked us in!
All the windowshave bars on 'em.
I think the only way out of hereis through this duct system.
Guys, do the words"dead by dawn" scrawled
in feces over theremean we're in trouble?
Did you do it?I did.
Then no.
Still sticking withthe glasses, huh?
What? Oh, right.
Right, I have glasses.
They're such a part of me now,I-I forgot all about 'em.
You're gross.
You know, it's funny,
I-I've gotten an awfullot of writing done
at that very table.
You're a writer?(Stewie groans)
I-I like to considermyself an observer.
(chuckles) You have nicebreasts, for instance.
(chuckles)You want to join me?
Guy with glassescan't be all bad.
Thanks.
Boy, it's loudin here, huh?
Wh-When they said "ProfessorGriffin," I barely heard them.
That's it, I'm puttingan end to this.
I'm gonna destroy those glassesif it's the last thing I do.
You shouldreally check out
the Thanksgiving jazzCD they sell here.
(screaming)
Where the hell are we?
(footsteps echo)
I heard something.
Is... is someone else here?
Oh, my God,it's Hook-hand!
He's coming for us!
Damn it, why can'tI get any reception?
Because we're in a basementin the middle of nowhere.
Besides,if cell phones worked,
every movie would betwo minutes long.
Like An Affairto Remember.
Darling, I was runningto the Empire State Building
to see you,but I got hit by a car.
No wonder you were late.I'll be right down.
Are you okay?
I think I may be paralyzed.
I'm sorry, there's nobody hereby that name.
Wow, Stewie, thanks fortaking me to the spa.
Hey, you deserveit, buddy.
So just relax, takeyour glasses off,
take a nice,dry sauna--
no glasses inthe sauna--
just leave thosepuppies in the locker.
They'll be safeout here.
Sounds good.
(quietly): Come on, Chris.Don't let me down.
CHRIS:Don't worry, Stewie.
Chris! What are youdoing in here?
I did it.
I locked us in the sauna!
You what?!
Yep, it's all set.
It's turned up high,
and nobody is comingfor the whole weekend.
(pounding)
(gasping, panting)
Boy, you guys surelook steamed.
ANNOUNCER:This Family Guy joke waswritten by Jimmy Sullivan,
age nine, of Decatur, Georgia.
Thanks, Jimmy!
And we'll pass along yourgross request to Mila Kunis.
(water dripping)
(footsteps approaching)
Those footstepsare getting closer.
Those aren't footsteps.
It's an old building.Just relax.
Besides, I can see an exit doorright there.
Where?Right there.
Behind that guy with the hook...
(terrified screaming)
(screaming)
Everybody run!
(Joe screaming)
(thunder crashes)
(screams)
Wait a minute.
There's four of us,and one of him.
Yeah, let's get him!
(yelling)
Son of a bitch!Take that!
Die, Hook-hand!You won't kill us!
Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert,and he's dressed like a janitor.
(groans)I've been trying to help you.
I'm the caretaker here.
Wait, you work here?
But you havea hook hand.
I was a soldier.
I lost my handsaving six men in Korea.
Oh, God, he'sa war hero.
(exhales)
He's dead.
What have we done?
We killedan innocent man.
Well, if this doesn't justifya McFlurry, nothing does.
Oh, my God,we killed an innocent man.
W-We've got toreport this!
We gotta turnourselves in!
No way.
If we do that,we'll all go to jail.
And I'm a cop.
Do you know what theydo to cops in jail?
Hey, man, when you werea cop, did they...
did they let youuse the siren?
Yeah, it's partof the job.
That's so cool!
Hey, hey, whenyou were a cop,
when you were goingto a crime scene,
did you go "chung chung,"like Law &amp; Order?
No, that would bevery unprofessional.
All right,all right.
Oh, hey, check it out,man, when you were a cop,
did you ever, you know,use your handcuffs
when you were gettingkinky with your girl?
No, it's city property,
so you're not reallysupposed to take those home.
Oh, for sure, for sure.
Oh, hey, by the way,
a bunch of us are gonna killyou in the shower later.
Okay, so we're all onthe same page, right?
We bury the body,
we never speakof this again.
Deal.Got it.Yup.
Wow, that was exhausting.
Wait a minute, is-isthat... is that his car?
(car alarm wailing)
Aw, crap, it's still alive!
It does not feellike a Wednesday.
Peter, I'm gladyou're up.
I need to talk to youabout something.
I know what you didlast night.
You do?
How could you dosomething so heinous?
Last night,
you left your dirty dishesin the sink.
It's disgusting.
So I did half, and I leftthe other half for you.
Ah, forget it.You'll just do it wrong.
I'll wash 'em myself.
Why don't you just goin the other room and relax?
I'll call youwhen breakfast is ready.
Okay.
LOIS: Oh, my God, Peter,come look at the newspaper!
"Janitor dead."
(gasps)
What? No!
Right here.My college roommate, Jan Itter.
She passed away yesterday.
Are-are we reallydoing this?
'Cause I didn't get, like,any sleep last night.
What are youfreaking out about?
You didn't even know her.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,y-you're right, you're right.
LOIS: You and the guyskilled and buried a man?!
Ah, I knewyou'd find out!
Find out what?
I just gotDavid Sedaris' new book,
You and the Guys Killedand Buried a Man.
Okay, I amreally on edge
and this thing we're doing,I'm not happy about it,
and that's a very odd titlefor a humorist's book.
Peter, you're actingvery weird.
Just go inthe other room.
I don't want to goin the other room.
I want to stay here andsee what you're seeing,
because you're sayingthings that I think are
something totally differentthan what they are.
Peter, you're gonnahave a heart attack.
I won't say anything.I'll let you relax.
LOIS: "They found a bodyof a war hero
down by the old asylum!"
Okay, that has to be something.
(song playing on radio)Oh, sorry, Peter,
I'm just singing along withthis old John Mellencamp song.
&#9834; They went up thereto write a movie &#9834;
&#9834; Peter, Quagmire,Cleveland and Joe &#9834;
&#9834; Killed the old janitorwar hero &#9834;
&#9834; Just why,we'll never know... &#9834;
I don't rememberthis one.
Guess it's never beenin a car commercial.
&#9834; In a truckthat's built Dodge Tough. &#9834;
Oh, yeah, no,I know this one.
(whistling)
Hey, Bri?Yeah?
Aah! Damn it! Aah!
There's glass in my eye!
Oh! Son of a bitch!
Aah!
Mom says dinner's at 6:00.
She wanted me to tellpeople; I don't know why.
(groaning)
Guys, I'm kind of freaking outabout killing that guy.
Anybody else havea hard time sleeping?
No, but there's an oldJohn Mellencamp song
you're not gonna(bleep) believe.
Wait, w-what'sall this stuff
about you guyskilling someone?
Last night,at the asylum.
We killedthat war hero.
Whoa, whoa, what?!
You-you reallykilled someone?
Holy moly, I don't thinkI want to hear this.
Quagmire, you werethere with us.
You're so weird.
Last night, I wasin St. Louis.
I even havea picture.
See that?
That's yesterday's dateon that newspaper.
On The Quahog Informant?
They sell The QuahogInformant in St. Louis?
Well, probably, but goodluck with that whole
"you three and not mekilled a guy" thing.
Damn it, that bastardis bailing on us.
He's a worse accomplicethan Johnny Wind Chimes.
(chimes jingling)
Hey! Shh!
(loudly):Sorry! It's my chimes.
I hate to frame you like this,Quagmire, but I gotta.
I can't go to jail.
They'll razz me goodon account of my belly.
Cleveland?
What are youdoing here?
What are youboth doing here?
Joe?What the hell?
QUAGMIRE:You backstabbers.
What the hell'sgoing on?
I'll tell youwhat's going on.
Cleveland's trying to frame me.
He's got my miniatureportraits of cool guys.
Peter, those are baseball cards.
Whatever. He's using itto frame me for murder!
Well, I'm notthe only one.
Joe's got my Sports Illustratedfootball phone.
He was using thisas his main phone.
It is a mess over there.
Look at all youpathetic people,
bringing stuffto frame each other.
You're supposedto be friends.
Hey, that'smy shovel!
Damn right!That's how smart I am.
I only had to bring one thing.
This way, I can dig the holeand just throw this in.
But once you throwit in there,
how you gonna getthe dirt back on top?
Give me your shovel!
You're gonna haveto kill me first!
Not with my shovel!That's brand-new!
Give me backmy rattle-y plastic phone!
&#9834; &#9834;
Wait, wait, wait, guys! Guys!
What?
Don't you see?
This!
This is our horror movie!
(thunder crashes)
&#9834; &#9834;
It doesn't feellike a Wednesday.
Boy, that sucked.
Yeah, I guess writing a movie
isn't as easy as JosephGordon-Levitt makes it look.
Hey, at leastwe gave it a shot.
I just feel badwe killed an innocent man.
Well, don't feel too bad.
Look at that!
Oh, my God.
Wow, that's a relief!
We may have actually madethis town a better place.
Yeah, what a monster.
But at least nowhe's gone forever. </div>\t'
