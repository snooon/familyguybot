&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; is violence in moviesand sex on TV. &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; on which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy. &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; all the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; laugh and cry. &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;
Oh, uh, it sure was nice of you
to invite us out on your yacht,Mr. Pewterschmidt.
It's not a boat,it's a yacht.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thoughtyou said it was a boat.
Wow, it's beautifuldown there.
I just can't believe itreally looks like this.
Boy, the fish tankat day care

Lois, are you feelingall right?
I'm just a little seasick,that's all.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Brian's eatin' it.
Boy, that's a lotof puke, Lois.
I ain't seen that much pukesince my bachelor party.

Oh, my God, well,we are gonna fix that.
Carter,I am gonna throw you

- Why would you do that?- 'Cause I'm your pal
and I want to help.Like Cheeseburger Helper.

and make a delicious mealfor the whole family?

- Oh, really?- You bet.
How would you like to takea half pound of hamburger
and make a delicious mealfor the whole family...

Wha... I... I don't...
I... I could just take cheese
and put it on thething he's doing.
No! It won't bethe same!
Look,he's my brother.
He didn't get enoughoxygen at birth.
He's never gonna be quite instep with the rest of us
and this is sort of my wayof taking care of him.
Well, that's nice of you,but it was so much simpler
when it was just youand me doing our thing.
I know, but just lethim have this one.
Odds are he won't even comeback with the actual food.
Okay, Cheeseburger Helper,you're on.
Yay!
Cheese, cheese, cheese!
Yay!
I'm so sorry for your burden.
You're a good brother.
So what do you think, Carter?You having a good time?
I'm not sure what I'm supposedto do with myself.
I'm very uncomfortable.
Why don't you get a lap dance,Mr. Pewterschmidt?
No, Peter's crippled friend,I think I'm just gonna leave.
This was a stupid idea.
Aw, come on, you just gottarelax and cut loose.
Like those foreignguys over there.
I can't believeI'm back at the horse.
I had many drinks last night
and I was so hung outthis morning.
Aw, me, too, friend.
I was blowing chinks like crazy.
Boy, this is fun, huh?
Except for the fact we gottasit next to that woman
who came with herco-workers.
Huh, aren't we all pals?
I work at the office.
This is empowering.
Maybe I'll get a dance, huh?
You guys are probably gonna betalking about this forever.
A woman who's so coolwith all of this?
Jackpot!
All right, there's acute-looking one.
Excuse me, miss?
This older gentleman wouldlike a lap dance.
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing. You just sit thereand enjoy yourself.
Do I, do I stick the moneydirectly inside of her?
No, you do not.
Why, have you done that before?
- Doesn't go over.- When do I hit her?
Oh, for crying out loud,just drink this.
And you, give this old bastardthe ride of his life.
&#9834; &#9834;
Yeah!
- All right, go, Carter!- All right!
Get some! Get some!
Hey, Joe, that's likeright in my (bleep) ear.
Stop it! Peter, I... I...
Whoa!
Boy, she's bendy!
wow! Y... yes!
Oh! Awesome!
All right! Oh!
Oh, my God!What's happening to him?
I'm having a heart attack...ack... ack... ack... ack... ack!
You ought to know by now!
Oh, my God!
Is my father gonna beokay, Dr. House?
He's in a coma, Mrs. Griffin.
And listening to thesound of your voice,
I'd say he's the lucky one.
Oh, dear, I do hope there'ssomething to be done.
Dr. House, if you're gonnasave this patient,
you'll need this.
Get this thing outta my sight!
But wait a second!
How are you gonnaplay by the rules
if you don't havethe rule boo... oh...!
My methods are a littleunorthodox, Mr. Griffin.
I think I can help.
- What are you doing?- My job.
Sometimes people fakebeing in a coma.
This man's not.
Unless of course, the firstpunch knocked him out.
In which case, we won't knowfor some time.
- House.- Road House.
That, too.
Any word on Carter'scondition yet?
No, it's been three days
and I'm really startingto get worried.
What if he's in a coma for,like, twenty years
and he comes out of the comaand you guys are all dead,
but I'm still alive andI'm a famous race car driver,
and he's like "Aw, man,Stewie turned out awesome."
And he comes to one of my races
and I'm so surprisedto see him there, I crash,
and then I'm in a comafor twenty years,
and I wake up andhe's a race car driver.
Stewie, do you want to be arace car driver when you grow up?
Well, gosh, if you thinkI'd be good at it.
Hello, Mrs. Griffin,
I'm Kenneth Gould,Mr. Pewterschmidt's attorney.
I'd like to talk to youabout a few things.
As part of Mr. Pewterschmidt'sestate planning,
he has left video wills
applicable to a widevariety of situations.
Hello, if you're watching this,
it means they didn't cutthe rope when I climaxed.
As a result, I'm now dead.
That's not it.
If you're watching this one,
it means the train wasn'table to push the Delorean
up to 88 miles per hour andI'm still stuck in 1885.
This couldtake a while.
...eaten by sharkswhile snorkeling...
...stabbed to deathin a Toys-R-Us bathroom.
...1940s roller skateleft in the hall.
Death by chocolate.
No, no, leave it in.
...had a heart attack and haveslipped into a coma.
Here we go.
In that case,I leave control of my company,
Pewterschmidt Industries,to my daughter Lois.
What?!
I don't know the first thing
about runninga billion-dollar company.
The board of directorsis fully prepared
to run the company inCarter's absence,
if that's what you'd prefer,Mrs. Griffin.
Well, yes,I think that'd be best.
Well, now waita second, Lois.
- I could run the company.- You?
You can't run a businessthat size.
You have no experience.
You know whatthat is, Lois?
That's you playingby the rule book.
And I don't playby the rule book.
- Right, Dr. House?- Well, don't ask me.
My superiorsthink I'm crazy.
Scared ya, didn't I?
- House.- House.
And I'm gonna runthe company.
Well, Lois,I'm off to my first day
as a corporate bigwig.
I'm not so sure aboutthis, Peter.
I mean,that's Daddy's company.
He spent his whole life buildingit from the ground up.
And you don't know anythingabout running a big business.
Whoa, whoa, thanksfor the vote of confidence.
Geez, you're a bigger downerthan a German bedtime story.
And in addition,
Pewterschmidt Industries'pharmaceutical division
is up over 30%,
profits in new media havedoubled each quarter
over the past year,and our stock is at an all-time high.
All right, stand aside.
I'll take it from here.
Good afternoon, gentlemen,
my name is Peter Griffin.
I will be running the companyfrom hence here forth.
Now, I want you all to laysome business talk on me.
I need ideas.
What can we do to make thisquarter more quarterly?
Well, come on, come on.
Okay, I can see I'm gonna haveto get things rollin'.
All right, we're gonna do anexercise called the idea ball.
I'm gonna toss a ballto one of you,
and whoever catches it,throw out the first idea you got,
then pass the ballto the next guy,
and he throws out an idea and so on.Everybody clear?
Yeah.
All right, here we go.
All right, Abrams, whaddaya got?
My lung's collapsing.
You know what I'm hearin',gentlemen?
What's the best way to put this?
What I'm hearing...
What I'm hearin' is alot of yesterday talk.
This isn't the way we're gonnado things under my leadership.
We are gonna turnthis company around.
But, sir, the company'sdoing fine.
Better than ever, in fact.
Mr. Pewterschmidt would...
I don't care what Mr.Pewterschmidt would have done.
We need to take risks.
We need a complete overhaul.
Gentlemen, you're all fired.
What?!
There, now that I've gotyour attention...
you're all fired.
Peter, what the hellis going on?
You fired everybodyat Daddy's company?!
- You bet.- Are you outta your mind?!
Keep it up, Lois,I might fire you.
You wouldn't.
Does the name Lacey Chabertmean anything to you?
Okay, I'll behave.
Yes, you will.
Look, Peter,all I'm saying is,
those guys have beenwith Daddy for years.
How are you supposed to runthat company without them?
That's it, Lois,you're fired.
Chris, you arenow Meg's mother.
Ooh, Peter, your musclesare so muscley.
I am gonna plow youso gross later.
You are a team of executivesI can trust.
Brian, Quagmire, Mort,

You are gonna help me leadthis company into the future.
Peter, we don't knowanything more than you do
about runninga company.
Hey, where's Joe?
I think he's still outside.
Hey, Joe!What're you doin' down there?!
There's no ramp!
I can't get inside!
Well, we don't need him anyway.

He fired all my staff,

and now he won't step down!
I know, Daddy.
He's become so fullof himself.
He's more annoying than whenhe's making his Christmas list.

Yeah, yeah,that's it.
All new this Christmas...remote control cars...

You know something?
You're not qualifiedto sit in that chair.
Oh, aren't I?
Maybe there's a rabbithead under here.
Peter, all of my father's assetsare tied up in that corporation.
If you freeze up his money,
he's not gonna haveanything to live on.
Now you are gonna make amendswith Daddy, and that's final.
All right, Lois,if that's what you want.

I'm sure we canfigure something out.
Hmm... I don't know if I likethe sound of that laugh.
I knew I didn't likethe sound of that laugh.
Peter, this isunacceptable.
What gives you the rightto treat me like this?
You've been treating melike crap
for twenty years, Mr. Pewterschmidt,and now I'm the one in charge.
Hang on a second.
Clean that up.
Carter, as your boss,
I command youto have a viewing party
for tonight's episodeof The Big Bang Theory,
and you have to go cubicleto cubicle inviting people.
Aw, come on, Peter, I'm not...I'm not good with rejection.
I'm your boss.Now do it!
Hi. I was gonna catchThe Big Bang Theory tonight,
and wondered if you wantedto come over and watch.
Wha... What?What is that?
It's a comedy.It's on CBS.
I'm really into it.
I don't wantto watch that.
I don't want towatch it with you.
All right, if you changeyour mind, here's a flyer.
If you do decide to come,
I'm just askingthat you bring an appetizer.
Yeah, I'm notgonna do that.
See, Peter, I told you,no one wants to come.
- This is awful.- You're not off the hook.
You still gotto have that party.
Babs, you want tosit and watch...?
No.
I'll have you knowthat I can bench press
over 690 billion nanograms.
Sheldon, that's lessthan two pounds.
It sounded betterthe way I said it.
Oh, when I tell that jokeat work tomorrow, people...
people... people are gonnabe sorry they didn't come.
They're... they're gonna...this... this was...
this... this was a good night.
Carter, as your boss,I'm ordering you
to pay a compliment to thissharply-dressed Asian man.
You look very nice.
What else?
- Uh...- What about my shoe?
They're nice, too.
How you thinkmy house smell?
Not oniony?
You good man.
I pat you on the head andfeed you from the hand.
And then he made meclean out the fridge
in the employee lounge,and the employees were mad at me
Because I... I threw out foodthat they still wanted.
I don't knowwhat's in there!
Oh, that's it.
Peter is completelyout of control.
We've got to do somethingto take him down
and get your company back.
Right, right. But how?
In order to oust an idiot,
we've got to thinklike an idiot.
Let's see.
What's Peter's weakness?
He's got to have a weakness.
Swamp monsters.
Swamp monsters, of course!
Lois, what are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to makesure everything was okay.
Of course it's okay.Why wouldn't it be?
Oh, you know, that wholeswamp monster story.
Swamp monster?
- You haven't heard?- Heard what?
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.
It's just, apparently,
somebody flushed ababy swamp monster
down the toilet somewhere,not far from here.
What?! Who would flusha baby swamp monster?
Don't they knowwhat would happen?
Well, apparently,it has happened.
And now it's grown up
and is attackingimportant businessmen.
I'm an importantbusinessman!
What the hell was that?!
It sounds like maybea swamp monster
who needs to projecta little more.
Ah, crap!
Aah! A swamp monster!
Quick, Peter,sign this legal document
giving the companyback to Daddy so you won't get eaten!
Oh, I don't understand,but nothing makes sense
in these swamp monster times.
We did it, Daddy.
I have my husband back,and you have your company.
Sorry I'm late, Lois.
Okay, are we doing theswamp monster thing?
Wait, if you're Daddy,then who...?
S... s... s... s... s... s... s...Swamp monster!
Now let's find outwho you really are.
Dr. House?!
Indeed, Lois.
And if you don't mind,I'll address you
in my natural speaking voice,
as I've grown so wearyof doing an American accent.
Do you want to come
to my Big Bangviewing party next week?
Daddy, you don't haveto do that anymore.
I know, I know.I... I... I like it now.
Well, I'm sorryyou lost the company, Peter,
but I think it's for the best.
You were turninginto a real jerk.
Well, maybe so.
But I sure am gonna missbeing a corporate big shot.
Well, you'll always be a bigshot in this family, sweetheart.
Thanks, honey.
And I got a littlesurprise for you.
In that contractyou signed,
you got to keep thecorporate plane.
Yeah!
Peter, how areyou doing that?
I... I don't...I don't know, Lois.
I'm scared.
Well, come down.
I can't. I... I...Get help.
Call somebody.
Wh... wh... who do I call?
I... I don't know. A police...a fireman... a scientist!
Call a scientist!
Okay, you kids stay herewith your father.
I'm gonna go finda scientist.
Am I gonna die? </div>\t'
