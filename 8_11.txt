Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons.
In traffic news, heavy gridlockon the 195 interchange.
We now go live to Drunk Billyin the Channel Five newscopter.
This just in.Channel Five newscopter pilotDrunk Billy passed away today.
In anticipation of this event,we put together a clip package
featuring some of Billy's workfor Channel Five News.
(CROWD SCREAMING)

(WOMAN SCREAMS)
"I'm still hungry,"said the very hungry caterpillar.
"But you've already..."
Drunk Billy will be missed.
But what you shouldn't missis the Quahog Rodeo,
coming to the Civic Centre Friday.Tickets are on sale now.
For those who are handy witha horse, entry spots are still open.
This seems like the kind ofthing Peter... Too late, Brian.
Peter, you're gonna enter the rodeo?That's stupid.
You don't know about horses,and you're in terrible shape.
That's the difference between us.
When life comes knocking,you hide in the kitchen.
I fling the door wide open and say,"Peter here. What do you got?"
And look at this.In this week's TV Guide, it says,
"Peter getsmore than he bargained forwhen he joins the rodeo."
Well, it's in the Guide.Hey, can we make that a thing?
Can we start calling TV Guide"the Guide"?
I'm not even asking any more.That's what we're doing.
Who says I couldn't be a rodeo star?
I got more cowboy blood in methan Billy the Kid.
# BILLY JOEL:The Ballad of Billy the Kid
# Well, he robbed his wayfrom Utah to Oklahoma
# And the law just could not seemto track him down
# And it served his legend well
# For the folks, they loved to tell
# About when Billy the Kidcame to town #
Hi-yah! (SCREAMING)
Dad! What are you doing?
All right, Meg, this is onlygonna hurt for about three weeks.
What the hell?
That there's my steer, Griffin.
All right, Lois.Go ahead. Say it. (SIGHS)
Chris! It's time for supper!
(CHRIS SCREAMING)(MIMICS COWBOY URGING HORSE)
(MIMICS CALMING HORSE)
All right. I am ready for the rodeo.
Mom, when's it Dad's turn?
I don't know, Chris. But I thinkwe should all pray for your father
that he comes out of this uninjured.
Those horses stink.And it's too hot in here.
I fell asleep in the car,so now I'm cranky.
This is a disgusting display.Boy, you can say that again.
Nothing like a bunch of adult menteasing animals for fun.
It's amazing thatthis is still legal.
The only reason I'm here is cosmy idiot friend is in the rodeo.
I only camecos I'm writing a magazine article.
One of the competitors isa 13-year-old female riding prodigy.
Apparently she got on the bullto miscarry,
and found out she hada talent for it.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,give an indifferentEast Coast welcome
to the newest bull-rider,Peter the Kid!
(CROWD CHEERING)
(SCREAMS)(CROWD GASPS)
You know what I am back atthe ranch? I'm a breeding bull.
(STAMMERING) What's that?You gonna find out.
Where you going, fatty?We gonna have a party!
(SCREAMING)
No! (SCREAMING)
No! No! No! No!
(GASPS)(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
So, what magazine do you write for?I'm the editor for Teen People.
Editor? Wow. Gosh, you know,I'm something of a writer myself.
I wrote for the New Yorkerfor a little while.
Wow, that's impressive.Are you looking for work?
(CHUCKLES) Oh, no. No. I neverhave to look too far for that.
(STAMMERS) What do you got?
We're looking for someone to writea piece on the everyday activities
of the average Americanteenage girl.
Oh, I love teenage girls.It's all ahead of 'em, you know?
They haven't turnedinto bitches yet.
(SIGHS) It's true.What happened to all of us?
I got a house on the Cape.Maybe you come visit. Maybe.
Maybe you call a few days in advance
to give me timeto get the house clean. OK.
Maybe you bring a blazer so we cango to a wider range of restaurants.
I'll bring a blazer.
You see this, Rupert?Most children build a sand castle.
But I'm building a sand retreatfor singles in their 30s.
(IN DEEP VOICE) Hi, I'm Jeremy.I work in corporate finance.
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)Hi, I'm a French-Canadian girldown here on my vacation.
It's a big deal for meto be down here on my own.
I like the swimming poolwith a bar in it,
cos you can sit on a barstooland you're in the water.
I like how all the food and drink isincluded in the price of the ticket.
Yeah, that way you don't have tobring your cash down from the room.
OK, I was just lookingfor a friend of mine,
so maybe I'll see you later.
Good for you, Janine.You promised yourself you'd talkto somebody, and you did it.
(NORMAL VOICE)Brian, what are you doing up there?
Shh! I'm writing an articleon teenage girls.
I'm studying Megto see what goes on during her day.
Be carefulyou don't fall off that ladder.Not all dogs go to heaven.
So, says here you were involvedin the plotting of September 11th?
Well, that's what they getfor supporting Israel.
(CHUCKLING) Gosh!
OK, into the eternal pit of fireyou go.
Aaagh-hoo-hoo-hooey!
You know, Brian, just because you'rewriting a profile on teenage girls,
it doesn't mean you have to bea creepy stalkerand follow Meg all day.
It's called research, Stewie.I'm just being thorough.
Where the hell is she going? There'snothing out in this part of town.
What is that, Brian? What isan adult correctional institute?
It's a prison, Stewie. Ah.
One would thinkthey could just say that.
Hi, Meg. Hi, Luke.
(BOTH GASP)
Oh, my God. Meg's dating a convict.
Eh, looks likeConsuela's son is in prison.
I see you soon, Rodrigo. Si, Mama.
It's really good to see you, Meg.It's been a while.
I know. I'm sorry, Luke.It's so hard to get over herewithout anybody finding out.
Have you gotten the lettersand hair I sent?
It's the only thing that'sgetting me by. Thank you.
How did your parole hearing go?Not good.
Looks like I'm gonna be in hereanother three years.
Oh, Luke. I don't expect you towait for me, Meg.
No, I will, Luke.If it takes ten years or 20 years,
I will be here when you get out.
Oh, my God.Meg's involved with a convict.
Wow, Meg's like one of thosecrazy chicks
who hooks up withan even crazier guy.
Brian, you bastard!How could you do this to me?
I'm sorry, Meg. I had to tell them.
Don't give him crap for this, Meg.
He did the right thingby coming to us.
Don't you know what kind of fireyou're playing with,dating a prisoner?
Hold on, Lois.This is some serious parenting.
I'm gonna go put on my Cosby sweater.
Mom, you don't understand.Luke and I really connectvery deeply.
He's all alone in there,and I'm all alone out here.
In a way, we're both in prison.Meg, there's a big difference there.
He's in prison for a reason.He broke the law.
He robbed a convenience storeto pay for medication for his mom.
Oh, I'm sure he gave youa very convincing sob story.
It's not a sob story. It's true.
Frankly, I don't care, Meg.I do not want you seeing him again.
I can't find the sweater.How did you even meet him?
We had a pen-pal project at school,and when it was over,
Luke and I kept writingto each other.
Well, it stops now!But, Mom, I love him!
It stops now, Meg!Your mother's right, Meg.
You gotta be careful who you getinvolved with romantically.(MOBILE RINGS)
Hello?I'm in the mood for some coitus.
Get over here.I can't. I'm with my family.
Pick up wine on the way.
Well, Angela,if I'm really the only guy at work
who can solve it,I'll be right there.
(SOBBING)
(KNOCK ON WINDOW)(GASPS)
Luke! What are you doing here?I escaped, Meg.
I escaped cos I just couldn't bearanother second away from you.
My God! How did you get out? I filed down a toothbrushto a fine point
and stabbed the guardwith the most kids.
What? I'm just kidding. Oh.
I'm still getting usedto your sense of humour.
There was a riot in the prison yard,and I slipped over the fence.
Well, quick, get in herebefore somebody sees you.
Oh, Meg, I've wanted to do thatfor so long.
And it's nice to be in front ofsomeone for a change.
(LAUGHS) Now I know that was a joke.(CHUCKLES) Whatever.
Hey, Meg?Can I talk to you for a second?
(RUSTLING NOISE)
MEG: Uh, yeah. Come on in.
Listen. I feel like I shouldexplain myself a little bit here.
I'm sorry I had to tell Loiswhat was going on. You just...
You gotta realise I was onlythinking about your safety and...(LUKE SNEEZES)
(GROWLING)
(SIGHS) Luke, you might as wellcome out now.
Luke! They let you out of jail?
Not exactly. He broke outto see me, Brian. We're in love.
Meg, are you crazy?You can't harbour a fugitive.
That's a felony.Only if someone finds out.
Are you gonna do it? Are you gonnatell on me again? Well, I...
Brian, will you call meon my Mickey Mouse phone?
Why is that guy wearinga prison jumpsuit?
Think, Peter, think.
Wait. Hang on.
Sunday... Sunday... Here it is.
"Peter gets more than he bargains forwhen he joins the rodeo..."Boy, did I.
"..and Meg dates a prison escapee!"Oh, no. Luke, run!
Joe? It's Peter. Two things.
Firstly, when I was overat your house the other day,
I forgot to tell you how much I likewhat you and Bonnie did withyour living-room furniture.
Second, come outside,there's an escaped convictrunning across the street!
(GASPS)
No, Luke, don't run downhill!
(GRUNTS)
You're going to jail, punk!
No, Mr Swanson, you can't take him.
Yes, I can, Meg.He's going back to jail.
Well, if you're taking him to jail,you have to take me, too!
I know. That's the plan.
You're under arrestfor harbouring an escaped convict.
Oh, well, that's only fair,because after all, I did hide himfrom the... What?
Uh, hi. Did you also get caughttrying to vote in Ohio?
Well, this is it.Meg gets out of jail today.
Already? Seems like just yesterdaywe rented her room
to that fly that wants to leavebut can't figure it out.
FLY: OK, now where now?PETER: Right there.
I'm having some trouble.Right in front of you!
OK, I can hear you.Volume's not a problem.
I'm just not quite seeingwhat you're referring to.Fly out the window!
Up here, maybe?No! To your left!
No, that's just more wall.How many eyes do you have, huh?
Just two, same number as you,but, you know... I'm not...
Just go! Oh, my God!Whatever it is you're driving at,I'm just not getting it.
You're right there!So I'm just gonna go back upstairs.
I think we should all go togetherto pick Meg up.
She's probably fragileafter being in there so long,
and I'm sure she'll be heartenedto see our faces.
I'm home. You're all my bitches now.
OK.
Meg. You look so different.How was prison?
First question, who's the biggest,toughest guy in this house?
I don't like to toot my own horn, butI believe I hold the distinction...
(GRUNTING)
My house now, bitch!Now who's the funniest?
I know my way around a joke.
(GRUNTING)
For God's sake, Dad,have some humility!It'll save your life!
(GRUNTING)
There better be beer in the fridge.
Boy, I liked her betterwhen she was more predictable.
Like the stock photoson a corporate website.
WOMAN: I'm a woman in a lab coatwearing goggles,
staring at a beakerthat I'm holding near my face.
MAN 1: I'm a Latino in a hardhat,but I'm also wearing a tieso you know I'm a supervisor.
MAN 2: We're college studentslistening to our professor,
but the class is taking place...outside?
(SHOWER RUNNING)
Hey. Meg! What the hellare you doing in here?
Shower time.Yeah, for me! Not for...
What are you doing with that loofah?Don't worry about it.
(SCREAMS)You told me not to worry about it!
I should have been worriedthe whole time!
Meg? Honey? I did all your laundry.
Oh, my God! What is that smell?
It's my poop bucket.What the hell?
I'm used to going to the bathroomin my room.
That's disgusting! No, you usethe toilet here like everyone else!
No. Ugh! God! It smells horrible!
Can you at least empty iteach time you use it?
I like to fill it up.I'm not making a million trips.
Oh, my God! Are you using my shirtsas toilet paper?
Yeah. And I think I might need someright now.
Get out now or stay and get weird.Your call, warden.
Hey, who's the new dude?
Oh, my God! That's Meg Griffin!She just got out of prison!
Hey, Meg, what did they put youin jail for? Being ugly?
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hey, Meg, what happened? Did youget out early for fat behaviour?
(ALL LAUGH)
Nice tattoo. Did you getyour butt hair braided, too,
while you were in there?(ALL LAUGH)
What did you do, carve a gun out ofsoap and then not wash with it?
Pee-ew! (ALL LAUGH)
Hey, Meg, are you gonna takethose soda cans
to the Shaw-Skank Redemption centre?
(ALL LAUGHING)
Peter, Meg's been suspendedfrom school. That's OK.Whatever she wants to do.
She cracked three kids' skulls open!
Ever since she's gotten out ofprison, she is out of control.
That's what the penal systemdoes in this country.
It turns small-time offendersinto hardened criminals.
Look at Meg.They took an innocent little girl
and turned her into a psychotic,sociopathic freak.
(ALL GASP)What did you say, Brian?
Oh, I was picking upon something Lois said.
What did you say, Lois?Something about Meg being a freak?
Oh, no, I didn't say anything.
Peter said something about Meg,which I completely disagree with.
That wasn't me. Stewie was reallylaying into Meg about something.
Yeah, Stewie. Definitely Stewie.Oh, so now everyone understands me.
Look, Meg,we're just worried about you.
Well, don't.I can take care of myself.
I'll be outta hereby the end of the week.
Punch yourself in the face.(WHIMPERS)
Punch yourself in the face!(WHIMPERING)
All right, he doesn't knowwhat he's doing.
You, fatso,punch your baby in the...
I did good, Meg? Shut up.
I did good. I did good.
(ENGINE STARTS) Drive.
Um, any particular direction?That way.
You're gonna help me get some moneyso I can get out of this town.
Really? Where are you gonna go?I don't know. Somewhere far away.
Maybe China.I hear they got NASCAR there now.
(ENGINES REVVING)
(ALL CLAMOURING)
What kinda birdhouse can you buildwith Popsicles, roofiesand a mallet?
It's for a rare African birdcalled none of your business.
Hi, Meg. Can I help you?
Hands in the air, Goldman!Oh, my God! What are you doing?
Give me your money!Here! Here!
Just take this jarfor the leukaemia kids.I don't give it to 'em anyhow.
Meg, put down the gun.Brian, get back in the car!
Look, don't do this.This isn't you, Meg.
What happened to the girlwe used to know?
The one that Luke fell in love with?The one he's expecting to see
when he steps out of that prisonin 40 years?
I don't care about Luke.I don't need him.I don't need anyone!
If you don't put the gun down,I'm gonna be forcedto call the police.
Good! Call the police!I want you to!
What do I careif I go back to prison?
Nobody cares about me anyway.
You're wrong, Meg.I wanna show you something.
Teen People?It's the article I wrote about you.
You wrote an article about me?
They wanted a storyabout a typical teenage girl.
Is it "A Fistful of Backne:Tale of a Teenage Loser"?
Yeah, they make the title.Read paragraph three.
This isn't a library, you know.
"And in the faceof every adolescent challenge,
she looks at the worldthrough hopeful eyes
and maintains an uncommon resiliencethat can only be admired.
In this sense, Meg Griffinis not the typical American girl.
She is far sweeterand kinder than that."
Oh, my God. That is so nice, Brian.
Did you mean all that?Of course I did.
Oh, my God,I can't believe I did this.
I was just so tiredof being everyone's whipping girl
that it felt kind of goodto do some of the whipping.
Give me the gun, Meg.
Thanks for reminding mewho I really am.
Well, at least I didn't get robbed.(DOOR OPENS)
And what can I do for you fourfine black gentlemen today?
I gotta say, Meg,I like you so much better like this.
Me, too, Meg. God, it must have beenhorrible in there.
It wasn't so bad.I met Wesley Snipes.
Is that right? Yeah.
And you know what's funny?He was Inmate 57, too.
Huh? He was Inmate 57?
See, he did a movie calledPassenger 57.
Ah. Well, terrific.Always end on a strong joke.
