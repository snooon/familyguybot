&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;

Is she a prim and properaunt ("ONT")
or a big, fat,dirty aunt ("ANT")?
I have no obligationto tell any of you anything.
Mr. Griffin has shown goodfaith in appearing here today
and will not be subjected
to this sort ofhostile interrogation.
Your father doesn't like totalk about his sister, Meg.
They've neverreally gotten along.
Wow, Peter.In all the years I've known you,
you've never evenmentioned a sister.
Big deal, I don'ttalk about my sister.
I also don't talk aboutthat tickling uncle.
All right, Uncle Dan,remember: no tickling.
(chuckles)You got it.
(laughing)
You didn't say anythingabout Uncle Neil.
Whose uncles are you?
It says here your sister'scoming for Thanksgiving.
She what?
CHRIS: If we're havingguests, can I invite
Rosario Vargas fromthe third district,
a leader youcan depend on?
I don't wantKaren here.
Peter, you've been avoidingyour sister for too long.
Besides, she says she's beenhaving Thanksgiving
with your mother forthe last 20 years.
And now that your momhas passed,
she'd like to spendThanksgiving with you.
(whispering)
No.
Peter, Karen's comingand that's that.
How cool! I didn'teven know I had an aunt.
I can't waitto meet her.
Look, I'm telling you guys,it's gonna be a disaster.
Just like the alternateending of Back to the Future.
&#9834; &#9834;
Well, if I'm gonnadisappear into nothing,
I might as well bang my mom.
Hey, Lorraine, wait up!
Hi! My name's Marty!
I'm in a picture!
&#9834; &#9834;
To be contondered!
TV ANNOUNCER:We now return to The Cosby Show,

(The Cosby Show theme playing)
Huh. I was so busynot seeing color,
I didn't see the raping, either.
Okay, everyone.It'll be another hour
before the turkey's done,but I made more appetizers.
Ooh, grape jelly on a Triscuit.You're a whiz.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.Save your appetite.
And don't thinkI haven't noticed
you've already had two drinks.
You're, like, all the worstparts of a girlfriend.
(doorbell rings)
Oh. That must be Karen.
I'll get it. Aunt Karen?
And you must be Meg.
Do that to me!
(giggling)
Wow, it's so cool that I've gotan aunt I didn't know about.
Oh, Karen, I'm so happyyou could make it.
Lois Pewterschmidt.The one that got away.
I'm just joshing, kid.
Auntie's not a biscuit-bumper.

Wow, Karen,nice to meet you.
I'm Glenn Quagmire.
I didn't knowPeter even had a sister.
What are you,ashamed of me, Chin Nuts?
Oh, my God. His chin kindof does look like nuts.
Ha, ha! I nevernoticed that.
How could younot notice it?
Watch this,I-I'll punch him in the nuts.
Eh, sort of clever.
Wait a second. I know you.
You're that lady wrestler.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,he's right.
Hey, w-what do theycall you again?
Heavy Flo.You're Heavy Flo!
In the flesh and blood.
Gross.Man, you're amazing.
I remember when you called outAndrea the Giant
the day after September 11.
What just happened wasa national tragedy,
but it's nothing comparedto what I'm gonna do
to Andrea the Giant!
We will never forgetwhat happened yesterday,
but you'll also never forgetwhat's gonna happen September 17
at the Jack WitschiSports Arena!
Peter, I can't believe you'vekept your sister a secret.
She's amazing!
Yeah, she's crazy strong.
Like Superman on a date.
Yeah, I wasn't here,but I heard her scream,
so I came flying inand found her like this.
It's weird.Same cause of death
as those three guysin that local public bathroom.
Unsolvable.
Now do you see why I didn'twant Karen here, Lois?
She terrorized memy whole childhood.
Now she's got to embarrassme in front of my friends?
Peter, Bonnie justchanged Joe on the table.
What are youworried about?
Still, I don't wantto go back out there.
Look, I knowyou've had your differences,
but Karen's your sister.
And you're grown-ups now.
Can't you just go out thereand pretend to have a good time?
Fine, I'll play along.
I guess I've lied before.
Where you going?Home.
Where's home?
The White House.
Okay, I'm here.This is my house.
You can go now.Thanks for taking me home.
Go ahead, go inside.
I will.You can drive away now.
No, no, I-I want to makesure you get inside safe.
Yeah, but I-I got to lookthrough the mail first.
You know how it is.Really, I insist.
I-It's totally okay. Go.
At this point, it's moreabout me than it is you.
It's a badneighborhood.
If I don't seeyou go inside,
I'll be thinkingabout it all night.
(sighs)
(whispering)
Uh... come on in,Mr. President!
(laughter)
And then, so I'm like, "Peter,how was I supposed to know
you didn't want your teammatesto know you wore a bra?"
(laughter)
It was a custom-designedsports halter top.
More stories!More stories!
Hey, tell one wherePeter is a nincompoop
or maybe a Silly Billy.
(laughs)
Oh, man.
Okay, let's justcarve the turkey.
Oh, Aunt Karenalready carved it.
She did?But that's my thing.
I always do my "are you a legman or a breast man" joke.
Aunt Karendid that, too.
It was hilarious.
I never really got ituntil she said it.
Ha, ha!
Hey, Karen,later you got to show us
some of your wrestling holds.
Yeah, what's that trademarkfinishing move of yours?
The Toxic Shock.
Oh, yeah,that move is badass!
You're awesome.Know what else is awesome?

You're welcome.I'm in a good mood.
Sure, what the hell,I'll show you my moves.
Maybe after dinner.
No, no, no. The familyfootball game is after dinner.
We do it every year!
Peter, calm down.You're making a scene.
It's not my fault, Lois.She's ruining Thanksgiving!
The way Tim Burtonruined the Fourth of July!

&#9834; La, la, la! &#9834;
&#9834; Weirdness, weirdness &#9834;
&#9834; Patriotic weirdness &#9834;
&#9834; Barbecuing human heads &#9834;
&#9834; Every president is dead &#9834;
&#9834; Everybody's gonna die &#9834;
&#9834; Have a dark and dead July! &#9834;
(yowls)
Fat chicks with black hairget tattoos of me!

The teams are chosen bya lottery system where...
Aunt Karen, can Ibe on your team?
Yeah, yeah, me, too!
Uh, yeah, sure,I'll take, uh,

We'll kick off.
Hey, time-out!
Did anyone tape the parade?
Please tell mesomeone taped the parade!
(grunts)
(sighs)
(groaning)
Oh, my God! She'sdoing The Toxic Shock!
(groaning)
(gasping, wheezing)
Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen!
What the hell was that?
That's his stutter.
And whenever he stutters,he usually pees his pants.
N-No, I... d-d-don't.
(groans):Oh.
So this is football.
I like it.
Hi, Dad.
Look, I-I just want you to know,I feel bad about what happened
with you and Aunt Karenthe other day.
Oh, you mean when she put me inthat no-bottom James Bond chair
and assaulted my grundle?
I didn't evenknow about that.
Well, that's 'causeit didn't happen.
I'd kick her ass if shetried something like that!
Dad, stop. Even I can seethat your sister's a huge bully.
And trust me, I know more aboutgetting bullied than anyone.
You do? How?
&#9834; Celebrate good times,come on &#9834;
&#9834; Let's celebrate &#9834;
&#9834; Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh &#9834;
&#9834; Celebrate good times,come on. &#9834;
Man, I love that song.
Dad, what I'm tryingto tell you is,
I now see why you've beenso tough on me all these years.
'Cause it makesmy friends laugh?
No, because that's howAunt Karen treated you
when you were a kid.
(gasps loudly)
That's right. And that's whyyou need to confront Karen.
Oh, no. Oh, no.No, I can't do that.
I tried for yearsto stand up to her.
Nothing ever worked.
What, so nowyou're gonna quit?
You can't quit.
What if Muhammad Ali had quit?
Ah, my grandchildren!
Who would like meto read them a book,
or maybe paint their nameon a grain of rice?
Honey, dinnertime!
Ah, my favorite.
Hot soup.
Right in there.
Dad, I know you canstand up to Aunt Karen.
And maybe if you finally do,she'll stop terrorizing you,
and you won't have totake it out on me
for the rest of my life.
You know what, Meg?
You're right!I'm gonna do it!
You are?
Damn right!
Yay, Dad!
I am gonna becomea lady wrestler
and defeat Heavy Floin the ring.
Wait. What?! No! What?!
I meant go talk to her.
Nope, it's got to be alady wrestling match.
Hey, Meg,Thanksgiving's over.
Come help mewith the Christmas decorations.
Meg! Help me withthe Christmas decorations!
Comments? Questions?
What the hell are you...
I'm sorry. Chris hadhis hand up first.
Chris?
What's the capitalof Maryland?
I do not know, but that'sa very good question.
Now, Lois?
Peter, what the hellare you doing?!
First, it's not Peter.
When I am in this outfit,I am Maxi Paddy,
the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.
Peter, you look--okay, that's clever--
but, Peter,you look ridiculous.
Take that off.
If you want to settle thingswith your sister,
just go talk to her.
No, Lois, the only way tosettle a family dispute
is in the cage.
I mean, you don't understand.
Karen made me feel worse than
a guy getting cutfrom a baseball team.
You wanted tosee me, Coach?
I'm sorry, Kyle.You can't do this boring,
stupid thing with us.
All right, Peter,your sister's the real deal.
So I arranged for youto get some combat pointers
from my old buddy,Steven Seagal.
Uh, this... this fat guy?
Yup. Go on, ask him anything.
How... how did...?
Uh, why-why you so fat?
Okay, ask him aboutanything but his weight.
(sighs):Uh...
uh, you act Asian,you look Native American,
your name is possibly Jewish.
What are you?
He fat.
All right, Peter,most professional wrestlers
become addicted to painkillersat some point.
So I figure,why don't we just start now?
Uh... okay,yeah, I'm in.
Where you gettingall these?
Stepdaughter's purse.
Ain't my problem.
Man, I love putting my hand downmy pants when I'm on drugs.
We should just go live on aboat in some guy's backyard.
So, you gonna dothat wrestling stuff?
Nah, I'm gonnastick with these.
I would crimefor more of these.
Okay, now if you're gonna defeatyour sister in the ring,
you got to get to the rootof your fears.
We got to go backto your childhood,
so I'm gonnahypnotize you.
Okay, go back.
Now, we need to goback in time.
(high-pitched voice):My jeans are husky.
Okay, further. Further.
Little further.
Now, open your eyesand tell me what you see.
(demonic voice): I see the sixstations of the Lord's order,
and they will all burn!
Okay, too far!Too far! Too far!
Come back. Come back.
Come back.
(high-pitched voice): Hey,can I make my husky jeans
into cutoffsfor swimming?
Ah, forget it. You're ready.
Yeah, Peter.I think you're gonna win!
All right! Hey, thanks forall your help, you guys.
You know, there'sonly two things

Right you are, Bill.
Tonight, she's up againstHer Vajesty's Secret Cervix.
Interesting fact:these two gals have
over eight meters ofass crack between them.
One! Two! Three!
(crowd cheering)
It's over!
And once again, a Heavy Flo hasruined another lady's evening!
(cheering continues)
PETER:You ain't no champ!
Not till you go through me!

I was named after my father,Maxwell Patrick.
But that's enough about me.
I'm here to kick your ass!
Get out of here!
I'm not fighting some fat loserfrom the crowd.
Huh. It looks likethis Heavy Flo is pee,
because you're yellow!
CROWD:Oh!
Well, that didn'tquite track,
but the crowdseems to be on board.
It sure does!
Looks like Heavy Flohas a challenger!
All right, get up here,but make it quick.
I got a Lampoonreunion to get to.
Heavy Flo, alwaysfinding a way
to drop her Harvard degreeinto conversation.
Yes, veryoff-putting, Bill.
Those of us who went to Harvardreally don't appreciate it.
(bell dings)
(grunting)
Ow! Damn it, Karen!
Karen?
Peter, is that you?
What are you doing here?
Something I should have donea long time ago.
I'm tired of you bullying me!You're going down!
VENDOR:Butt-scratcher?!

I tell you, this isone for the books,

Wow, you reallysaved me!
Thanks, stranger.
Dad, it's me.
(gasps) Meg?
It was you who saved me?
That's right, Dad.
Wow, even after all thecrummy stuff I've done to you?
But why?Because you're my dad.
And I couldn't stand byand watch you get hurt.
Wow. Thanks, Meg.
You know, that's somethingeven my own mom and dad
never did for me.
They just stood by andlet Karen pick on me.
Well, you deserve better.We all do.
You know, Meg, I'm really sorry
I treated you so badlyover the years.
I guess I was taking outall the pain I felt on you.
I understand.Better than anybody.
But I still love you, Dad.
I love you, too, Meg.
Did somebody ordera hot-ass bitch and this lady?
Oh, you're alive.
Sorry, I was toldI was in charge now.
Well, if you die,this is kind of
the creative directionI'm leaning toward.
Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.
You finally stood upfor yourself.
So, Peter,have you talked to Karen?
I called, like, four times, butshe's not out of the coma yet.
Apparently, they usuallyuse fake chairs,
but Meg used a real one.
Do they thinkshe's gonna survive?
It could go either way.
(phone ringing)Hello? No, I think I'm adifferent blood type.
No, I don'twant to check.
Doctor says there'snothing they can do. </div>\t'
