Boy, I must havebeen really drunk.
I don't rememberany of that.
No problem.
Instagramremembers for you.
Peter, we've got a housefulof people coming

Well, if they'reexpecting a turkey,
I'll just put onEvan Almighty for them.

You and Brian better getanother turkey right now!
And don't bothercoming back until you do!
Don't worry, Lois.We will.
Yeah, we'll be backwith a turkey
faster than you cansay, "Jack Robinson."
Jack Rober...
(slurring)
(slurring):Jack Row...
She had a stroke that killedthe part of her brain
that says "Jack Robinson."
We got plenty of time.
All right, Brian,first order of business--
we have to decidewho gets to ride in the cart
and who has to push it.
Well, I'm smaller, so...
The decisionhas been made.
Ooh, now I want that one.
Aw, crap-- looks likethey're completely sold out.
Yeah, sorry.
We just sold our lastturkey to that guy.
You are the turkeyI have chosen to pardon.
Fly free, turkey!
(driver screams)
Oh, Fudgsicles!
Hey, you don't sellturkeys here, do you?
We've been to every grocerystore in town with no luck.
No, the only thingwe really sell here
are these little packetsof weird vitamins
that vaguely suggestthey help you in the bedroom.
"Performance andstamina, for men."
I know what that means.
(playing "Stars and StripesForever")
Peter, enough.Come to bed.
Uh-uh, Lois.
The packet says I got toplay till I'm raw.

What? What are youtalking about?
Well, the fat man's nevergoing to get back in time,
and with him gone, that makesyou the man of the house.
I sentence you to death!
Chris, Chris, slow down.

You have to do everythingthe fat man normally would.
You mean, like,fall asleep on the toilet
and have a big red ringon my bum for a week?
No, no, no-- greetingguests as they arrive.
Facilitating small talk.
And, of course, givingthe Thanksgiving toast.
Boy, yesterday I'mmicrowaving a cat,

Things move fastaround here.
Hi, do you have any turkeys?
Sure do.You're looking at one.
(laughs):I'm sorry.
You have to know meto know I'm just joking.
Sir, the day we've had,
we could usea good chuckle like that.
You folks are in luck.
Looks like we haveone turkey left.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, you're telling me.
We didn't come backwith a turkey,
Lois would be madder thanthat time she got a Capp smear.
All right, we're just goingto take a quick Capp smear.
Don't you meanpap smear?
No, at this hospitalwe obtain the sample
using beloved British comicstrip roustabout Andy Capp.
'Ello, luv.
Let's have a smear.
I'm not lettingyou do that.
You can't even see.
That's all right, bird.I goes by smell.
Brian, look,an eight-foot basket.
Let me just dunkthe turkey once.
I know I can jam it.
(grunts)
That's nota regulation rim.
Okay, you know what?I'm in charge of the turkey.
You're driving.
This thing on?
Yes.
It's not makingany noise.
It's a hybrid.Trust me, it's on.
No, it's not. See?
(whirring)
(both screaming)
(gasping)
Oh, my God!
(Brian grunting)
(gasping)
Not now! Not like this!
(gasping, coughing)
Peter, what the hell?!
You chosea turkey over me?!
I almost died!
I swear to God, I thoughtdogs could breathe underwater.
Great. The water completelykilled my phone.
Oh, horrors.
You have to spendtime with me
without lookingat your phone.
Here, give me yours.
I threw mineat a duck.
Excuse me, can you help us?
We're trying to getback to Quahog.
If you want, I can take youas far as the bus station.
You can?Oh, thank you so much!
Oh, that is the nicest thinganyone's done for me
since my kids gave methat Father's Day gift.
Oh, look, a tie.Perfect.
It's from all of us!
All right, Chris,acting as host
will demand a higherlevel of conversation.
I suggestas your opener--
"Lois, everythingis delicious."
Then that'swhat I will say.
Unless Slender Mancommands me
to say something else.
Ugh, this is gonna bea bigger disaster than Y2-Gay.
ALL:Three! Two! One!
I hope my dad'snot watching ABC!
Oh, thank Godwe got on this bus.
I really had to poop.
Wait, where is therea bathroom on this bus?
I didn't say therewas a bathroom,
I just saidI had to poop.
MAN:Oh, my God!
This is grosseven for a bus!
(grunting)
I don't know whatthey were so mad about,
I did it ina Rite Aid bag.
Damn it, Peter!That was our only way home!
Well, that's whereyou're wrong, Brian.
Free bus bike!
Aw, crap, thisis a girl's bike.
All right,we'll ride it,
but pray to God nobodyfrom school sees us.
Nice bike, butt-munch!
Shut up!I'm telling Miss Baumbakis!

(fabric ripping)
Oh! Ow!
Damn it, Peter!
Oh, great.
You broke the chainand now we have to walk!
Unless we hitchhike.
Hitchhike? You knowhow dangerous that is?
Besides, we're inthe middle of nowhere.
There aren't evenany cars around.
There's one.
Hey! Hey, stop!Give us a ride!
It's just me and my upright dog.
We're obviously not weirdoes!
See, Brian? Told ya.
We're going to be homein no time.
Hi there, folks.
Hand over the turkey.What?!
I can't go back to my wifewithout a turkey!
Oh, yeah?

Sometimes I pluck thembecause I deserve pain.
Cut! No. Stop.
I'm sorry! I panicked!
It's all right. It's okay.Don't worry, Chris.
You can't always get thingsright on the first try.
Just look at Snoopy'soriginal happy dance.
(light jazz playing)
Hey, you havinga good time tonight?
(aggressive grunting)
Oh, yeah.
Can't believewe got robbed.
Yeah, but can we justtalk for a second
about how brave I was whenwe walked past that cemetery?
Peter, do you not see that weare completely screwed here?
And it's allthanks to you!
You drove my car into a lake,you almost let me drown,
you got us thrown off a bus,you broke our bike,
and now you've gottenour turkey stolen
and Thanksgivingis ruined
and we don't haveany transportation
and we're stillmiles from home!
You're starting to getblack gums like an older dog.
You know what? You know what?Maybe it's my fault.
I forgot, I'm talkingto a complete idiot.
You are so stupid!
Oh, yeah?
Well, if I'm so stupid,
then how did I manage toframe you for eating the turkey?
What?!Yeah!
Didn't you notice you werepassed out in all those photos?
You didn't eat any of it.
I just posed you like that
because I didn't wantto take all the blame.
You son of a bitch!How could you do that to me?
You're a dog, Brian.
I can throw youoff a bridge,
and as long as I don't hita person on a boat, it's okay.
Screw this. I am done!
This isn't even my problem,it's your problem.
You know what, Peter?
You've got no turkey,and now you've got no friend.
Good-bye!
W-Wait-- Brian, wait!
&#9834; Now let's watcha whole bunch of ads. &#9834;
Nice Thanksgiving.
I don't know why I ever listento that jerk.
What?
Home is this way;we're both just walking home.
Leave me alone!
No way. We're a team, Brian,whether you like it or not.
Just like almond butter
and no sugar addedfruit preserves.
Who's hungry?
BOTH:We are!
NARRATOR:Hey, kids, would you likea terrible healthy sandwich?
BOTH:No.
Too bad, becauseyour recently divorced mom
has a crush on her trainer,and he eats like this,
so now you have to, too.
Almond butter and no sugaradded fruit preserves--
just like PB and J,
but with moreof your mom railing this guy.
I named myself Kaya!
We stopped being a team
when you framed me for eatingthat turkey with you.
Brian, maybe you should bea little less mad at me
and a little more madat the guys
growing mustachesfor this month.
Hey, don't mockMo-vember.
Last year, I raisedeight dollars
and got ona BuzzFeed listicle.
No! You use real words!
Internet stuffis not real words.
Hey, look!
There's our answer.
We break into the zoo,steal a turkey,
bring it home, we're heroes.
Peter, stop it!
You're gonnaget yourself hurt.
Sorry, can't hear you.
Too busy savingour family's Thanksgiving.
(sighs)Damn it.
This is idiotic.
You're never gonna finda turkey in there.
Oh, I'll find one.
I mean, you'relooking at the guy
who found theFountain of Youth.
It's very faraway from here!
Hey, Lois,thanks for letting Kevin
bring his girlfriendthis year.
And I hope it's not awkwardthat she's a little person
and they viciously fightall the time.
Why do we have to spend everyholiday with your family?
Shut up!I'm a full-size person!
I make the decisions!
Don't you worry.This'll quickly turn
into rough,front-yard, makeup sex.
All this fighting ismaking me so damn hot.
Oh, my God.
It looks like he'schalking a pool cue.
Hey, scoot over.
As the oldest guy here,
it's my duty to takean open mouth nap
in the middle of the room.
(snoring)
(grunts, groans)
(snoring resumes)
God, look at my mom.
Dinner should've been servedhalf an hour ago.
She's clearly stallingfor time.
Okay, everybody.
Dinner's gonna be readyvery soon.
(grunting)Uh, what?
Um, oh, good. (grunts)
But before we get started,
I thought we could all taketurns telling a long story
about how things aren'tthe way they used to be.
Daddy, would you careto start?
You bet I would.
Too much candy!
Too much candy?
What do you mean,too much candy?
There's too much candy!
There used to be four candies.
Bulls-eyes, Yahoos,Sweet Yarn and cigarettes.
Now I go into a store,
I don't know whetherI'm coming or going!
Is there anything else?
Why don't ballplayers weargiant woolen shirts anymore?
What's wrong with wool?
It was a perfect fabric.
You go to the ballpark,get your bag of Bulls-eyes
and watch Hack Wilson roundthe bases in a big wool shirt.
I once saw Hack hit a ballout of the infield.
I still rememberthe thud of the bat
and the whoosh of the wool.
(sighs)I wish things were still heavy.
Oh, the rails areoff this thing.
All right, Chris,this is where you, as host,
need to step in and...
Chris? Chris?
What the hell?Are you drunk?
I couldn't handlethe pressure, Stewie.
We Irish,we have a deep sadness.
Oh, come on, get up!They need you down there.
(slurring):&#9834; Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral. &#9834;
Ugh.
(turkey gobbling)
All right, there they are.
I'm going in and gettingus a turkey, Brian.
Hey, buddy, you wantto come to my house
so my wife can cook you wrong?
Ah, damn it!
(turkey gobbling)
Peter, this is never gonna work.
All right,just leave the turkey alone.
The poor thing is... Aah! Aah!
What the hell?!Knock it off!
Ow! Damn it, I'm gonnakill you, you dick!
Quick, Brian,it's getting away!
(turkey gobbling)
Where'd he go?
(chimps screeching)
He's not in here.
Over there!
(grunting)
Oh, crap.
(lions growling)Easy there.
Hey, it's Thanksgiving.
Shouldn't you be in Detroit
losing a football gameright now?
(roaring)
(growling)
PETER:Brian, up here!
(roaring, growling)
Oh, my God.
Thank you, Peter.Thank you so much!
Hey, you're welcome, buddy.
You...
You saved my life.
Of course I did.
You're my best friend.
Hey, listen, I'm-I'm...
I'm sorry I messedeverything up today.
(sighs)It's okay.
I guess I've beenkind of a jerk, too.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Ah, I deserved it.
I mean, for God's sake,I sank your car in a lake.
And I brokethis guy's neck just now.
Yeesh.
But, hey, we cut the legsoff him and dye him brown,
we got ourselvesa turkey, right?
No. We've come this far.
Let's do it right.
Hey, you got a tiny headand a big body.
What if I switched that?
Gotcha!
All right, we did it!
We got ourselves a turkey.
Yeah, but whattime is it?
I mean, dinner has tohave started by now.
We're never gonna makeit home on foot.
Maybe we don't have to.
We're now arriving in Quahog.
Up on the right are the peoplewith the awesome trampoline,
but they don't let meon it no more,
'cause I bounced a kidonto the house.
There were nosqueezable condiments.
Ketchup came in a can.
And, Daddy, what about the pantsthat kids today are wearing?
Are they properly sized?
Are we gonna eat soon?
I have an interesting factoid
about what makes yousleepy afterwards.
Yeah, the hell with this.I'm starving.
Okay, I guess we should eat.
Well, obviouslyPeter's not here.
So it's fallen to meto take up the mantle.
Now, I wasn't planning ondoing this today,
but when I look around at allof these open, loving faces
or friends and family,
I'm comfortable enoughto finally say
that I am a proud,unashamed, active...
Lois, we're homeand Thanksgiving is saved!
Kidding!
Oh, my God, where thehell have you been?
And what are you doingwith a live turkey?!
A live turkeywho loves Rollerblading.
Our dog drew that.
Peter, we can't eata live turkey.
Look, Lois, I still got timeto make this right.
And I'm gonna.
Hand me a nine ironand show me to the backyard.
Well, buddy, I guess this is it.
Aah! Aah!
Wow, I-I...
I read that look wrong.
Ah, geez, I'm sorry.
I wish you didn't have to die,
but a bunch of white peopleput on sweaters.
I couldn't do it.What?
I'm sorry, Lois.
I know you wanted theperfect Thanksgiving,
and I know I screwedthat all up for you,
but when youthink about it,
isn't this holiday aboutbeing with people you love?
I mean, does it really matterwhat we eat?
What mattersis we're all together.
Family and friends.
And one new friend.
Oh, Peter, that's beautiful.
Lois, can the turkey pleasejoin us for dinner?
Not as the meal,but as our guest?
Of course he can.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
(gunshot)
(slurring):The man of the house
killed a turkeyfor Thanksgiving!
Well, looks like we'rehaving turkey after all.
(everyone laughing)
PETER: Four years later, me andLois divorced and Stewie died.
Gobble, gobble! </div>\t'
