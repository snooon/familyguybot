&#9834; It seems todaythat all you see &#9834;
&#9834; Is violence in moviesand sex on TV &#9834;
&#9834; But where are thosegood old-fashioned values &#9834;
&#9834; On which we used to rely? &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a family guy &#9834;
&#9834; Lucky there's a manwho positively can do &#9834;
&#9834; All the things that make us &#9834;
&#9834; Laugh and cry &#9834;
&#9834; He's... a...Fam... ily... Guy! &#9834;

Hey, you guys, you knowthat song "Jimmy Crack Corn"?
Yeah, it's me and Lois'swedding song-- what about it?
Well, the whole time theguy's saying he doesn't care
that, uh, this Jimmyfella cracked the corn,
but yet he wrotean entire song about it.
Cared enoughto put pen to paper.
Are you on vacation?I am.
Here's those friesyou ordered.
And your hot sauce.
Hot sauce?
On fries?
Mm-hmm, oh, yeah.
Black guys put hotsauce on everything,
on account of most of usbeen pepper-sprayed
by the time we're two.
Can't taste nothing unlessyou got that burn on there.
This stuff ain't that hot.
Whoo!
I feel like I'm crying,
but, like,out of my neck and back.
Look at his face.
He looks likeOliver Platt
climbing a flightof stairs.
Hey! That's a low blow.
I'm gonna call the networkand complain.
Where's the phone?
WOMAN:It's upstairs, Oliver!
Eh, they know what they did.
Tell you what, Peter.
I'll give you tenbucks if you drink
an entire shot glassof that hot sauce.
Let me see the money.
You-you don't believeI have ten dollars?
I think he's afraid.
Am not!Prove it.
Ten bucks.All right.
This is for allthe teachers who told me
I'd never amountto nothing.
(coughing, choking)
Oh, my God!
That last one was morecaliente than hot.
But still, holy crap!
Well, here's your money.
This is awesome!
I can get peopleto pay me ten bucks
just for doing stupid stuff?
Man, I haven'tmade money this easy
since I invented the Yanket!
Peter, what's wrong?
Well, I want to masturbate,but I'm just so darn cold.
Too bad there's no answerfor that problem.
But now there is.
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin,creator of the Yanket.
If you're anything like me,
the number one problemin your life
is that you can't masturbatejust anywhere.
But now you can.
Introducing the Yanket,
the only blanketwith built-in decoy arms.
Our patented processmakes it look like you're...
holding the remote
or sipping a beer.
Meanwhile, your real hands
are under the blanket,going to town.
Peter, whatare you doing?
Nothing. Let's watcha Scarlett Johansson movie.
But wait, there's more!
We have Yanketsfor all occasions:
Hey, what's going onunder that blanket?
You'll never know.
&#9834; &#9834;
All right, you guys.
I will now do anythingfor ten dollars.
Who's got something for me?
I got one.I'll give you ten bucks
if you wear the same pairof underwear for a month.
Pay up.
Uh, actually,you owe me $20.
Ew. Here's $50,go change your underwear.
(whimpering):It won't come off.
Hey, Peter, you wantto earn another ten bucks?
Course I do.
Great, I gota hilarious one.
I'll give you ten dollarsfor your L4 vertebrae.
(monitor beeping steadily)
So, uh, I guess this meansPeter, you're our Joe now,
and Joe, you're our Peter.
That means you got to doanything for ten bucks.
Okay.
I have a request.
Yay! Joe's chin!
Hey, Peter, I justthought of something else
you could do for ten bucks.
Yeah, you know...you know what?
I... I'm, uh,think I'm gonna,
um, upping my priceto $12.50.
No, you ca...no, you're locked in at ten.
Yeah, no renegotiating!
It was a joke.
Shut u... Just-justpoint me to the thing.
All right, we're gonna openthis fire hydrant
and you're gonna drink asmuch water from it as you can.
Chris has Crohn's disease.
Get down there.
Don't-don't-don'ttell us that now.
I think this is howAnna Nicole Smith died.
Don't make light of that.
Holy crap!
We-we-we got to get out of here!
Aw, man, the library.
White Fang?
This is for ruiningmy eighth grade summer!
(panting)
(screams)
(grunting)
(gunshot)Aah!
He ruinedmy summer, too.
&#9834; &#9834;
Oh, hey, Bri.
Still sittingin chairs, huh?
What'd your backever do to you?
I'm trying to watch.
Know what I'm watching?My core.
Your body and mind are supposedto be on the same team.
Sitting on the hard floor'sgood for your back, too.
Coming up:female high school teacher
sleeps with her students.
Is she hot? Stay tuned.
But first, the public librarysuffered damage this evening
when an area fat man
smashed throughthe front of the building
while attemptinga drunken stunt.
The bus station is expectedto absorb the overflow
of homelessarmpit-washing ladies.
Oh, God.
Peter, is there somethingyou want to tell me?
Uh, yeah, every lightin the house is on.
Did you destroythe library?
Did I destroy the library?
Ha, no, Lois.
That was television.
In light of eventsat the library,
we now go liveto a press conference
at the mayor's residence.
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm here tonightwith the deputy mayor.
Hi, everybody!
Shut. Up.
Anyway, these typesof immature, drunken high jinks
are destroying our town.
And if we can't trust
a 42-year-old manto drink responsibly,
then I have no choicebut to take action.
So, as mayor of Quahog,
I hereby raise the town'slegal drinking age to 50.
What?!
I can't drink anymore?
What am I gonna do?
What do people dowho don't drink?
I don't know.Knit?
Knit? Knit?!
Are you kidding me?!
Maybe.
Um, okay, so it turns out
I am, like,crazy good at knitting.
&#9834; &#9834;
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker
It's day three of Quahog'snew ban on alcohol
for anybody under 50.
And if there's one thing
the new drinkingage law has done,
it's let us know that womentell terrible stories.
Good to see youreyes open, Tom.
For more on this story,we now go to Tricia Takanawa.
Tricia?
Joyce, I'm standing here
on the streets of Quahog,
where citizens arefeeling the effects
of the city's new drinking law.
I was going to bonemy girlfriend,
but she told me that if
there wasn'tvanilla vodka involved,
there was no way.
I think we just have to trustour elected officials...
and Goldman's Pharmacyis fully stocked on cough syrup,
which goes greatwith ginger ale.
Well, I do miss drinking,
but I have used the timeto reconnect with my children
and I'm actually thinking aboutresuming my actuarial practice.
Oh, my God, he's justbeen drunk this whole time?
This new law sucks.
And I got to say,it was kind of uncool
of Mayor West to call it"Peter's Law."
No kidding.
Now I know how Meganfrom "Megan's Law" felt.
I... I don't... I don't thinkyou know how she felt.
I don't know why I didn'tthink of this before, guys.
We'll just gointo the brewery
after hours andtake some beer.
Hey, buddy.It's okay, I work here.
Aren't you the guy whocried in that meeting?
Oh, yeah, you know...you know, I just remembered,
there's no beer here, l-let's-let's just, let's just go.
Peter, why'd you want meto get us into this prison?
Because, Joe, everyoneknows that all prisoners
make bootleg winein their toilet.
We are gonnaget so wasted!
Oh! Look, right here.
This one's full of Chardonnay.
Peter, I don't think that's...
PETER:But it was Chardonnay.
The best ChardonnayI'd ever had in my life.
The man who made it,Curtis "Murder Dog" Williams,
went on to become
one of America'smost celebrated vintners.
JOE:Hey, Joe here.
Peter's lying.
He drank pee-pee.
Don't worry, guys.
If we can't buyalcohol in Quahog,
we'll just goto the next town over.
Sorry, in this town,you can only buy alcohol
if you're dressedhead-to-toe in jeans.
What? Who made that law?
Our mayor, Jay Leno.
Have you seensome of these laws
they've got nowabout denim?
You know, I say,
if you don't like it,you may as well Levi's.
Who's votingfor these mayors?
Rhode Island's a messfrom top to bottom.
&#9834; &#9834;
I tell you, guys,
getting alcoholwhen you're underage
isn't as easy as Obama'sdaughters make it look.
What? Is that true?
I don't know.
Hey, isn't thatyour dog at the bar?
Hey, Jerome, one more, neat.
What the hell?
Why's Jerome servingbooze to Brian?
I don't know,but I'm gonna find out.
(whistles)
Come here, boy!Come on!
Hey, what's up?We going for a ride in the car?!
No, no, I hada question for you.
Don't ever (bleep) do that
unless you havea car ride to offer.
Hey, how come you'reallowed to drink?
Yeah, you're not 50.
Uh, actually, I am.
I'm 56 in dog years.
Oh, is that why you gotwhite pubic hair?
I'll thank you notto check out my pubic hair.
Well, then don't goflashing it around.
Put on some underpants,you crazy old man.
Peter, I thinkyou're missing the point.
Brian can buy us booze.
Oh, my God,you're right!
W-Would you do thatfor us, Brian?
Sure, why not?
Aw, thank God.
'Cause just sitting hereall sober
is more boringthan watching a pot boil.
Hey, you.
What are you doing?
I like to watch.
I want to watch you boil.
I can't do itwith you watching.
Oh, not even if I do this?
Don't do that...
Oh, God, that's so hot.
Oh, yeah?
Then why don'tI take your top off?
Oh! Oh...
I'm boiling!I'm boiling!
Yeah.
Now I'm gonna stickmy raw pasta in you.
LOIS: Peter, what'sgoing on in there?
Making dinner, babe.

&#9834; Brass Monkey. &#9834;
Hey, hey, Brian, Brian.
How would youlike to build,
build a deck, rightnow, with your buddy?
'Cause we got hammers...
the whole deal.
I don't know, man.It's pretty dark out.
That's okay.
I'll just pullmy car around
and point theheadlights at it.
Did you know that my dadonce called me a mistake?
That's messed up, man.
Wow.
You know, Brian,hanging out with you
this past week has been awesome.
Yeah, why don't we,why don't we do this anymore?
We-we-we used to do fun stuffall the time, you know?
It used to be you and me.
And it alwayswill be, pal.
Hey, listen, listen.
I want you to beMeg's godfather.
No, thanks, Peter.
But this here,we got to keep this going.
I agree, buddy, I agree.
All right, I'm gonna go barfdown the garbage disposal.
Brian, I thinkwe can get John Mayer
to stop tweeting again,but we all got to work together.
Oh, my God!Are you drunk again?
Yeah, I was, I was just hangingout with my main man, Peter.
"Main man"?
"Hanging out"?
Brian, he's only usingyou to buy alcohol!
What?What are, wha...?
What are you,what are you talking about?
It hasn't dawned on youthat he only started
spending time with you whenthe drinking age was raised?
Come on, that's,that's not true.
(Peter retching)
PETER: Aw, shoot, I pukedin the clean dishes side.
Trust me, as soon as you'reno longer of use to him,
he'll be done with you.
Oh, I get it, I get it.
Okay, you're, you're jealous
'cause I'm spendingall my time with Peter.
Oh, yeah.Yeah, right.
Yeah, where's my dumb,morbidly obese friend?
CHRIS: Hey, Stewie,get in here!
I'm being an '80scomputer hacker!
Come on, baby, showme what you got.
And we... are in!
All right, I better go.
I got to go tell him"This isn't a game, man."
Brian, do you haveany idea why Peter
was trying to climbin the dishwasher?
I thought it wasa Tokyo apartment.
Sorry, Lois,we, uh, we got--
I guess we hada little too much to drink.
"To drink"?!
It's against the lawfor him to do that!
Was Stewie in here?
Was, was he in here?I... I smell his cologne.
Listen to me, Brian.
No more booze in this house.
You're gonna get usall in trouble.
Peter, we--maybe we should find
some place else to get--to drink.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Hi, we're herefrom the '80s FBI.
Somebody herewith a 2,400-baud modem
almost startedWorld War III.
(Glenn Frey's "The Heat Is On"starts playing)
Oop, sounds likethey're making an escape.
Hey, you want to see merun up that slide?
Sure.
(grunts)
Ow, damn it!
I think my belt bucklecut my gut!
Hey, Peter,can I ask you something?
You're not just hanging outwith me because I,
I can buy you alcohol, right?
What?! Course not.We're friends.
Yeah, no, I-I know. That's,that's, that's what I thought.
And also you bringme dead birds.
I know Lois getsmad about it,
but I like using themto point at things.
Hey, did theymove the bagels?
Yeah, they're right there.Oh, my God!
What the hell is that?!
This?This is a pointing bird.
All right, I just sawa sprinkler come on,
so I'm gonna go biteat the water a little bit.
Hey, what'sgoing on here?
Uh, some butthorn'sshining a flashlight on me.
I meant prior to me comingup and investigating this.
Oh, well, you gotto be clearer, man.
I'm wasted.
Sir, I'm gonnaneed to see some I.D.
You look underage.
Just as I suspected.
You're a minor.
It ain't my fault!
Somebody's been buying itfor me and all my friends!
Oh, is that right?
Well, you bettertell me who that is
or you're in alot of trouble.
Hey, is this the parkwhere Boner died?
Wait, wha-what's going on?
That's him, Officer!
That's who's beenbuying us the booze!
What?!
You get home, son.
You're lucky I'm lettingyou off with a warning.
But you, you're coming with me.
You got to be kidding!
Do you need a ride?
Nah, I'm just gonna stayhere until the sun comes up
and then be thebest at tetherball.
(grunting)
Next!
&#9834; &#9834;
What are you in for?
I bought some alcohol forsomeone I thought was my friend.
How about you?
I threw a bottle of rum throughthe window of the Apple Store.
I couldn't rememberme password.
(sighs)Well, this sucks.
Oh, it's not so bad.
Sometimes they let youtake the good trash home,
if you ask nice.
Last week, I gotan old greeting card.
It obviously wasn't for me,
but the imagination'sa hell of a thing.
(tires screech)
Hey, Brian, whattime you get off?
Me and the guys were hoping youcould buy us some more beer.
You can't be serious.
Eh, it's a littlebit serious.
Yeah, I haven'tbeen drunk in a day.
And I'm not feelingparticularly handsome.
Peter, you'rethe reason I'm here!
You totallysold me out to that cop!
Oh, are we just gonnaplay the blame game?
'Cause I got another gameI'd rather play.
Boggle.
Go to hell!You used me.
That's notwhat friends do.
It's what Adam Sandler'sfriends do.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'vegot a half a can of hot beer
left in this open containerI've been driving around with.
(glugging)
(belches)
You, too, pig.
Well, I'm not thesmartest man in the world,
but I can always look back onmy life and say I went for it.
Ugh, this seems like a weirdplace to even use a condom.
Just shut up, Peter.I'm done with you, all right?
You completely lied about whyyou were hanging out with me.
What?I never lie.
Well, except forthat one time.
Oh, my God!
My husband's havinga heart attack!
Is anyone here a doctor?!
I have a 13-inch penis!
(applause)
And besides,I'm sick of you
acting like you'resuch a victim.
You agreed to buy us booze,
'cause we weren't old enough.
You're not old enough?!
You're a manin his 40s!
This whole lawis ridiculous!
Hey, can one of you guyswith elbows
try to getthis truck to honk?
(truck horn honks twice)
Ah, that and giving noogies
is what I miss mostabout having elbows.
You know, Brian,what you said is right.
This law is stupid.
I mean, if itweren't for that,
we never would'vebeen in this fight.
Yeah, but what differencedoes it make?
It's the law.Nothing we can do about it.
The hell there's not.
I bet if we worked together
we could find a wayto change it back.
I... I don't know, Peter.
Come on, I know it seems hard,but we can't just give up.
I mean, what if ThomasEdison had given up?
Uh, what's that?
What's that thingyou're working on?
Well, it'sa lightbulb and...
A lightbulb!Lightbulb!
I invented that.
Me-- I'm Thomas Edison.
I invented the lightbulb.
Uh, what's it do?
It lights up a roomusing electrical...
Lights up a room usingelectrical stuff!
I was about to say that,because I invented it!
Uh, what areyou working on?
It's a phonograph...Phonograph!
I knew that,'cause I invented it.
I'm Thomas Edison.
I rule!
&#9834; Look it up &#9834;
&#9834; Edison was a dick. &#9834;
Okay, Peter, I know howwe can get the law changed.
I've been doing some research,and it says here
that in eight months, we canget a non-binding proposition
on the ballot as longas we get 4,000 signatures.
Ah, screw that,we're going with plan B--
threaten to killthe mayor's nephew.
I love you, Dad!
Peter, that's your son.
Shut up, Brian!
He's hugging me!
So, what exactlyis your plan, here?
You'll see.
Just follow my lead.
(doorbell chimes)
Ooh, trick-or-treaters!
Well, what do we have here?
A cowboy and a princess?
Uh, yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Mayor.
Oh, a Western princess!
All right, listen, we wantthat drinking law gone.
And everybody knows the best wayto get any law struck down
is to get the gaysangry about it.
Bruce?Jeffrey?
That's right,Mr. Mayor!
I needsmy Proseccos!
What are youtalking about?
You're 52.
(gasps)You said you was 39!
I was just tryingto get you in bed.
I thought we'd bothbe dead by now.
Crap. But come on, you gotto change that law!
I mean, it's alreadyruined a friendship
with one of the best guysI know!
CAROL:Adam, who's at the door?
Oh, hi, Brian.
Hi, Peter.
Wait a minute.
Is that, is that wine?
Yeah, Adam just poured mea little before dinner.
Wow, you guys eat late.
No, Peter,don't you see?
Carol's underage, too!
The mayor just brokehis own law!
Mm, that's a good point.
I guess I'll just haveto resign in scandal
while leaving the law intact.
Or you couldjust change the law.
But it's a good law.
No, it ain't!
Look, don't you understandwhat drinking
means to us working stiffs?
It helps us forget about our day
and tell our children welove 'em with a straight face.
It allows gross uggos to boofeach other's gross uggo parts.
And it gives people the courageto sneak onto their mayor's
property and blackmail himand eat all his ripe tomatoes.
That was a croquet ball.
Ah, then could you point me tothe closest nighttime dentist?
So listen, Mr. Mayor,what do you say about that law?
(sighs)All right, I'll repeal it.
But only if you send me andCarol a copy of that picture.
We don't have a lotof the two of us together.
Brian, we did it!We got him to change the law!
Just goes to show, if anybodywants a law changed,
they should just goto their mayor's house.
Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate
what you said there,about our friendship.
Well, to be honest, Brian,
at first I did just want youto buy us beer.
But then the-the morewe were hanging out,
I-I remembered how much funwe used to have together.
I guess after all these years,
I started taking youfor granted.
But you're still my best friend.
Even if I don'talways act like it.
I enjoyed hanging outwith you, too.
Thanks, Peter.
Hey, on your way out,
could you put this in mymailbox for the mailman?
Uh, sure.
Put the flag up?
Of course putthe flag up!
Geez, mail much?
&#9834; &#9834;
Well, Peter, I'm just happythat you and Brian
managed to getthat law repealed,
and that you'refinally friends again.
Me, too, Lois.
Good to havemy drinking buddy back.
Yay, everybody's happy!
I love this family!
I draped that over him.
He was just doing itout in the open. </div>\t'
