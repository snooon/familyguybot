(SINGING) It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex an TV
But where are those
good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do
All the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He 's a family guy
I was very brave when the doctor
gave me that shot, wasn't I, Lois?
Yes, Peter, you were very brave.

Even when I knew that
he was gonna give me the shot,
l just kept looking at him in the eye
and talking to him about my summer plans.
You did very good.
See, Peter? It wasn't so bad.
Yeah, except for having to sit next to
that screaming autistic lady
in the waiting room.
(SCREAMS)
(WHIMPERS)
(SCREAMS)
(WHIMPERS)
(SCREAMS)
(WHIMPERS)
(SCREAMS)
I don't know what you want!
I don't know how to help!

Hi, there. Excuse me.
I seem to be lost. Can you guys help me?
Oh, my God. Are you Ryan Reynolds?
From The Proposaland The Change-Up
and a ton of upcoming stuff?
Yeah, that's me.
I was on my way to Newport
and I kind of got turned around.
Of course, Mr. Reynolds,
we'd be happy to give you directions.
You take 138 to the Jamestown Bridge,
and you're gonna follow the...
There's a fire truck.
Yes, I see it, Peter. lt's a fire truck.
And after the bridge, just follow the signs.
Thanks. Hey, what happened to your arm?
I just went to the doctor,
got my cholesterol checked.
Wow. Why does a guy in his 20s
need to get his cholesterol checked?
Oh, come on, now.
Oh, hey. I never got your name.
- Peter. Peter Griffin.
- And l'm...
Catch you later, Peter.
Wow, he was really nice.
Not like when I met that bitch
Shelley Duvall.
Hi, l'm Shelley Duvall.
Very nice to meet you.
Big fucking deal.
Came right up to me,
like I was just dying to meet her.
Peter, you're gonna have to let that one go.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Hi, Mrs. Janetti. l'm here to pick up Stewie.
Oh, sure, Brian.
He's in the playroom with Gavin.
Gavin. That's a stupid name.
And nobody likes you at school.
I tried to stick up for you but I can't,
because everybody hates you.
You're gonna be ugly when you grow up.
And everything in your house is cheap.
And it smells in here.
Hey, Brian. Bye!
- That was fun. I like Gavin.
-(COUNTRY SONG PLAYING ON RADIO)
Yay! This is such a great song.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
I don't have to defend
Carrie Underwood to you.
She is doing just fine without you.
Brian, l'm just going to sit
in the car till the song's over.
All right, but don't take too long.
lt'll drain the battery.
Oh, shut up. lt's not draining the battery.
(SINGING ALONG) I took a Louisville slugger
to both headlights
I slashed a hale in all four tires
Maybe next time
he 'll think before he cheats
I should be on Glee.
I should be on Glee!
Oh, my God. l just drove.
(SQUEALS)
That was amazing. I can drive!
Now I can do a slow cruise
past my ex-girlfriend's apartment.
11:45 and the lights are on.
Doing it with the lights on now, whore?
Don't mind looking at his body?
I love you so much, though.
Lois, that dog with the
different colored eyes is back.
Eww. And gross!
It looks like he's got a boner.
LOIS: Peter, just leave him alone.
No, this is what Bob Barker's
been talking about all these years.
Go on! Get!
Get out of here, weird boner dog!
Hey, look who it is.
Hey, Ryan Reynolds.
What are you doing in Cleveland's house?
Well, believe it or not,
they've decided to shoot my movie
in Quahog instead of Newport.
I'm playing Hitler. But he's a young Hitler,
And he's got a rocking body.
lt's called Hotler.
(LAUGHS)
Color me seven bucks lighter.
Hey, l'm so excited that
we're gonna be neighbors.
- We should totally hang out.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Okay, l'm embarrassed.
L'm standing out here without a shirt on
and my pajama bottoms are
riding insanely low on my hips.
Hey, how much money you make?
You'd think enough for a shirt, right?
(LAUGHS)
So l'm having this housewarming thing
tonight, and l'd love it if you came by.
Yeah, that sounds great.
Anything beats what goes on
at my house Friday nights.
Hey, Lois, what's going on here?
Oh, it's my book club, Peter. Come join us.
Oh, okay!
(SNAPPING)
All right, let's see. New novel, new novel.
New novel. What's it about?
What's it about? A guy...
A guy who loses everything,
but finds his soul
in Canada.
All right, we're cooking now.
Cooking now.
And the whole book is an e-mail
to his daughter,
who's dead.
And his name will be Norm Hull.
Because he's just a normal guy.
But not everybody will get that.
That's just for the scholars
a hundred years from now.
Okay, Rupert, you ready to go for a drive?
Oh, my God, Rupert. This is such a thrill!
Look at me, l'm driving.
l'm driving a real car! I don't believe it!
Well, l'd say we need to put on some tunes.
WEENIE: (ON RADIO) Hey, welcome back to
Weenie and The Butt an 97.1.
CHORUS: (SINGING) 97.1!
Ooh! Weenie and The Butt.
Just like the grown-ups listen to.
THE BUTT: And that was Baby by
Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris,
which means it's time to give away
some Justin Bieber tickets!
WEENIE: That's right, Butt.
Our fifth caller will ween those tickets!
CHORUS: Fifth caller
Caller number five
MAN: Not four, not six
WOMAN: (SEXILY) Oh, five
MEN: (YELLING)
Cinco! Cinco! Cinco!
Hey, you know what, Rupert?
You know what I should do,
just, like, as a goof?
I should try to win those
Justin Bieber tickets
just so I can, like, tear them up
or use them to go to the concert.
It's ringing, Rupert. lt's ringing.
I'm too nervous.
They're celebrities. You talk to them.
(SCREAMING)
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
l'm in so much trouble.
TH E BUTT: Congratulations.
You 're caller number five.
You 're going to see Justin Bieber!
HERBERT: Oh, sweet Jesus! Yes!
Jesse, I wan! Never say never!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Brian's gonna be so mad at me.
What am I gonna do? Okay, it's all right.
I'll just get a little bit of paint
and cover up the dents.
Unattractive women do it all the time.
You look pretty today, Carol.
Thanks. lt's probably just
the dress and the makeup.
Now that I look closer, yeah,
I think that's what it is, too.
Hey, you made it!
And you brought a friend. Great.
I'm his wife, Lois.
We actually met the other day.
Oh, sorry, I meet so many people.
But there's really no way
you could know that.
- Yeah, she's a housewife, she don't know.
- Whatever.
You got booze in here?
Is it me, or did she just make that weird?
Please. It was definitely not you.
Hey, is this shirt too tight?
l'm feeling really self-conscious.
- No, not at all.
- So it looks good like this?
- Yeah, it looks good.
- Thanks. Now I don't know what to say.
Hey, I got, like, an insider
Hollywood question for you.
Is "L.A." short for something?
Ha! You're a riot.
Hey, hey, so what's all this about,
everyone in Quahog likes to tickle fight?
What is that?
- What? I never heard that.
- Yeah, apparently, it's like a thing.
- It is?
- Yeah.
I mean, they also said that people
who pretend not to have heard of it
- are chicken.
- Well, I ain't no chicken.
-(LAUGHING)
- One-nothing!
No, two-nothing!
Three-nothing! Fight over! Fight over!
Wow, you got a lot of catching up to do,
and tomorrow night in the dark, huh?
- In the dark?
- Yeah, if you say so.
Just don't tickle me in my lower abdomen.
l'm super ticklish there.
PETER: Lower abdomen.
You 're gonna wish you never said that.
This might be totally off-the-wall,
but are you doing anything Thursday night?
You probably have plans anyway.
You know what.
Forget it, forget it, forget it.
Nervous.
You know, Ryan, most people take one look
at me and just assume that I have plans.
Sol never get asked out.
But I frequently don't have plans,
so yes, I would love to do
something with you on Thursday night.
Yes! Oh, my God,
right now would be the worst time
for you to tickle my lower abdomen.
Because it's so exposed
'cause l'm cheering.
Yeah, Thursday night!
Your big mouth just got you in trouble.
- I lose.
- Peter one, you zero.
- Oh, I lose again.
- Peter two, you zero.
You've been practicing.
ANNOUNCER: (ON TV) We now return to
the end afa depressing 1970s sci-&#64257; movie,
starring a guy in a turtleneck.
(BOTH PANTING)
We've gone far enough.
I think we're safe from
The Corporation here.
Adzin, look!
(GASPS)
It can't be.
No! We'll never defeat The Corporation!
They've won!
There is one way, Adzin.
You can shoot yourself.
If it's the only way, I must.
(GUN SHOT)
(EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC PLAYS)
BRIAN: What the hell? Stewie, get out here!
Look at this.
Do you know anything about this?
About what?
About what a beautiful day it...
Oh, my God, that is surprising.
I had to stop that last sentence
In the middle because I was so surprised.
- What happened?
- Gee, I don't know.
Do you know what happened?
(CHUCKLES)
l'm sorry, what was that?
I was laughing at that funny thing
you said at dinner the other night.
What funny thing?
You remember what you said
about Lois's "potatoes au rotten?"
Huh.
Didn't think anybody heard that.
Wish you'd laughed at the time.
What the hell happened to my car?
Well, I don't know, man,
but the good news is,
it doesn't look all that bad, Brian.
It's just, it's that spot right there
that's upsetting you, right?
Stewie, I know it was you.
Your potato joke was terrible.
I can't believe you drove my car!
You could have gotten yourself killed!
L'm gonna have to tell Peter and Lois.
No! No, you can't tell them!
l'll be in so much trouble!
Stewie, I have to.
All right, I have covered for you
plenty of times before,
but not this time.
This is very dangerous, and I have to
make sure you never do it again.
I won't, I swear!
(SOBBING)
Stewie, calm down.
Sometimes in life, you just have to
accept what's coming to you.
Like the contestant
who gets the lesser showcase
on The Price is Right.
ANNOUNCER: Lindsay, your showcase
is all about relaxation.
And what better pla ce to relax
than in your brand-new hammock?
This sturdy and portable hammock
from Swingway
turns any patio into a tropical paradise.
And you can entertain yourself
on your patio by drawing with chalk!
Yes, Pratt and Millwood
eight-color pastel chalk
will turn your patio
into a tropical art studio.
But you 'll ha ve to pack your chalk,
because you're going to be
staying six days and seven nights
at your parents' house
in Wilmington, Delaware!
I moved my abortion for this.
Um, hey, thanks for taking me
out to dinner, Ryan,
but I got to say,
this food looks a little weird.
Oh, Peter, Moroccan food is the jizz.
I don't know. Looks like it might
give me the kind of farts I get
From eating Mexican food.
(FARTS)
(YELLING IN SPANISH)
-(FIRES GUNS)
-(ALL SCREAMING)
Hey, do these pants look all right?
Sometimes I put them on,
and l'm thinking I look all-balls.
- No, I think you're good.
- You think my balls are good?
(LAUGHS)
You're so weird. lt's awesome, though.
Oh, I...
I don't know.
Hey, have you noticed what a jerk
the mailman is in this town?
Like, he said there is no way
Peter Griffin could crush a baby bird
with his bare foot while I watched.
That guy talks more crap about me...
Mmm.Oh!
You got to taste this lamb tagine.
- Here.
- No, that... No, that's okay.
Come on, you'll love it.
Ah...
Just a taste.
(COUGHS)
That was intense.
What you just did.
Lots of... Lots of flavors.
Whoops.
Whoa, freeze frame!
What's gonna happen next?
I think I got to go to the bathroom.
(FARTS)
-(YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
-(COUPLE SCREAMS)
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in so much trouble
when they find out I wrecked Brian's car!
They'll probably ship me off to Siberia.
This sucks. I hate it here.
Shut up. Drink wolf milk
and watch Russian cartoons.
ANNOUNCER: We now return to popular
Russian cartoon, Shoe and Shoelace.
Shoe and Shoelace!
One is meaningless without the other!
(PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
Well, that's it. I have no choice.
I've got to run away.
(SIGHS)
Guess l'm on my own now, Rupert.
It could be worse, though.
At least l'm not getting stabbed
by some random guy on the street.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
See? lt's the exact opposite.
Ow! It happened anyway!
Hey, Stewie, you up?
What the...
Brian, I 've decided to run away.
Don't come looking for me.
And definitely don 't chase me to
the airport and catch me at the gate
just before I'm about to get an the plane
with, like, an em otianal speech
and possibly &#64258;owers.
For example, it would be awful if
all the TSA people were gathered around,
watching this emotional moment,
even the older black
female carry-an scanner
who initially stopped you
at the baggage check,
but who after you told her of your
intentions, said, "Go get him, child,"
in &#64258;agrant disregard
of all newly-implemented
post-9/11 security measures.
And if you were considering
bringing a boom box to play music,
I would suggest any one ofthese six songs.
So again, ran away. Don't come after me.
And I want to thank you
Dirty whores, all of you.
- Hey, Peter.
- Lois, we got a problem.
I think Ryan Reynolds is in love with me.
What? Don't be ridiculous.
It's true.
Last night we were at this restaurant,
and he tried to gay kiss me.
I'm telling you, he wants to get with me.
Peter, come on.
Why would any man
dress well, groom himself,
and lift weights
just to sleep with other men?
He's not gay.
Well, I don't care what you say.
He likes me.
And we do have chemistry,
I won't deny that.
I will take responsibility for my part in this.
I'm just gonna go over there
and let him down easy.
Oh, Snooki died.
Last stop.
What? This isn't the airport.
(DISTANT GUNFIRE)
Oh, my God, Rupert!
We've got to get out of here!
- Aw, damn it!
- WOMAN: Oh, no, no. Baby fall down!
Is that... ls that Consuela?
Baby all alone in street.
I take baby home.
It's me. Stewie.
Don't you remember?
You used to clean for us.
We used to make you use the bathroom
at the gas station.
- Hey, you.
- Uh, hey, Ryan.
- Bad time?
- Um... Perfect time.
Come on in. I was just oiling my legs.
So, hey, what's on for tonight?
You know, my dentist
leaves his office unlocked.
I was thinking we could do some nitrous
and then have dinner in there.
Look, Ryan.
You're a great guy and everything,
But I don't like you in that way.
I mean, there are some things
that I would do with you,
but my heart wouldn't be in it.
What are you talking about?
That you like me,
and you want to be my boyfriend.
(LAUGHING)
You think l'm gay?
Where did you get that?
Uh, um... You tried to kiss me.
Peter, l'm not gay.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Look, look, look,
let me put it to you this way.
L'm attracted to you
in the way that a man
is attracted to a woman,
But l'm not gay.
When you live out in Hollywood,
you learn that life is about different spirits
and energies you meet along the way.
I just thought maybe our spirits
could intertwine, you know?
Our energies could merge.
Like my spirit could go
up inside your energy.
I have so much to learn
about show business.
But you know what? I could never
really be attracted to somebody
somebody who uses labels
like "gay" and "straight."
Maybe you should just go.
Well, now, wait a second.
What do you mean?
This isn't working.
It was a nice thought, but I think
we should go our separate ways.
No, Ryan. I get it now.
I can be what you want. We could...
Peter. Don't embarrass yourself.
You need to just let this go.
- Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
- No, Peter, no!
- Tickle fight! Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
- Peter! No! No!
Oh, my God...
(SOBBING)
It's time for you to leave.
I can change.
I can change.
I'm sorry, Peter. We're done.
We can never talk again.
Here's a cellphone so we can always talk.
Don't you guys have any tub toys?
Here. Is rattle.
This is prescription medication.
And it's not even your name on the label.
What is this? What's in this tub?
- Is jicama.
- Jicama?
And what is... What? What?
This is a chicken leg.
Are you also making soup?
For quincea&#241;era.
Big party. Many peoples.
Oh, my God.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I bet even you guys
don't watch George Lopez.
Consuela?
Hey, it's Brian. l'm looking for Stewie.
No, no baby aqu&#237;
I peed in your soup.
Happy 15th birthday.
Which, by the way, is not
a special occasion in the normal world.
Stewie, l've been worried sick.
What the hell are you doing here?
Brian? How did you find me?
I used my nose,
which I always forget about.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, l'm not going back! I can't!
They're gonna be mad at me!
I didn't tell anyone.
You... You didn't?
No, I didn't.
Look, I thought about it, and to be honest,
it's probably my fault
for leaving you alone in the car.
And if you promise never to do it again,
I won't say anything.
Okay, I promise.
- My baby!
- What?
- I say, let go of me.
- Consuela, we're leaving.
My baby!
Hey, she says it's her baby, man.
Now get out of here.
Is my baby. Ernesto.
No, l'm not... l'm not Ernesto...
Okay, this is so eff'd up right now.
(SCREAMS)
I did not want to have to do that.
They were very nice to me up until then.
Peter, stop staring out the window.
Ryan's gone.
He finished his movie, he's moved out.
How could I have been so blind?
How could I not have seen what he offered?
I think the whole thing was very strange.
He thought you were strange!
How about that?
Whatever.
I just can't help but wonder.
Will I ever see him again?
