ANNOUNCER:We now return
to The Autistic PostmanAlways Rings 400 Times.
(doorbell rings repeatedly)
So is everybody excitedfor Father's Day on Sunday?
Oh, yeah,that's right.
I always try to avoidFather's Day now.
Every year, I used to takemy dad to the horse track.
Now we just go rooting aroundfor bargains at the mall.
Oh, this is darling,isn't it?Uh-huh.
Glenn, do you think you'd seemy bra through this blouse?Uh, I don't know.
Is it too sheer?I don't knowwhat that means.
Glenn? Do you thinkit's too sheer?
I said I don't know!
Hey, Joe, you know,come to think of it,
I've metCleveland's dad,
and my dog sleptwith Quagmire's dad,
but I don't know anythingabout your dad.
Yeah, is hestill with us,
or is he living in Heavenwith Jesus Christ?
Ugh, save thatfor your black friends.
Eh, my dad's outthere somewhere,
but I haven't spokento him in years.
What?! Really?!
Sorry, Cleveland,that was mean of me.
I already forgave you.
But, Joe, why haven't youseen your dad?
Well, he's a good guy,but we just drifted apart.
It's no big deal.
It's a very big deal.
My dad's a stinking drunkwho lives in Ireland,
but you gota perfectly good dad.
You can't waste that.
You gotta call him upfor Father's Day.
Peter, I don't even knowwhere he is.
Who's ready for another beer?
Hey, Cleveland, weren't yousupposed to buy the next round?
That's a shame Joenever sees his dad.
I know.
Hey, you know what?
Joe's our friend.
He should be with his dadon Father's Day,
and we're gonnatrack him down.
Yeah, that's agood idea, Peter.
Well, I likehelping people out.
That's why I was such a goodbreak-up rodeo clown.
I'm just gonna goahead and tell you.
I've been sleepingwith your sister.
What?!
Hey, now! Hey, now!Over here! Over here!
Over here! Hey, now!Hey, now! Over here!
Over here!Hey, now! Hey, now!
Over here! Over here!
(growls)
(echoing): Oh, and now thatI'm inside the barrel,
he gave youand your sister HPV.
Hey, want to see something?
Check out how hotmy last patient was.
Oh.
They look fake.
Yeah, who cares?
Okay, accordingto this projection,
Stewie's adult heightwill be five-foot-one.
What?!
Five-foot-one?!
Wow, Dr. Hartman,that's really short.
I mean, I suppose it's fineif he's gonna die at 14.
Is-is there anythingon there about that?
Well, we learnedin medical school
that the short onesdo go faster,
'cause they smell more fartsthan the rest of us.
This is terrible!
I can't be short!
I'll be an outcast, like Rudolphthe Uncircumcised Reindeer.
Look, Rudolph, it'snot me, all right?
It's Dasher, he'sbeen complaining,
and he is the one who hasto look at it all night.
I don't know.
Mrs. Claus saysit'll decrease my sensitivity.
I-I'm sorry, why are youtalking to my wife about this?
Okay, you guys,it's all set.
I found Joe's dadon the Internet,
and he just e-mailed meto say he's coming tomorrow.
All right, great, but remember,this is a surprise for Joe.
Why are youlooking at me?
Because you're terribleat keeping secrets.
No, I'm not;I'm great at it.
Like when I wasan ob-gyn.
Well, I got the resultsof your ultrasound,
and I got somenews for you.
Wait, wait, wait--(chuckles)
We don't want to knowif it's a boy or a girl.
(chuckling):Oh, okay.
Well, it'snot breathing.
Hey, guys.
Uh, uh, so, Joe,big day tomorrow, eh?
Father's Day.
Gonna be home all day,especially at 11:30 a.m.?
Peter.What? I didn't sayanything about his dad.
My dad?
What about my dad?
Well, now that Quagmire ruinedthe surprise, we found your dad!
You what?!
That's right.
He's coming tomorrow,for Father's Day.
You shouldn't havedone that, Peter.
My father's not gonnabe happy to see me.
Sure he will.
Just get him one of themFather's Day cards
what plays a song.
"Dad to the Bone."
"I'm Dad."
Pretty much anything with"bad," you turn it to "dad."
Wait, w-why wouldn'tyour dad be happy?
What, is he a jerkor something?
No, it's just thatever since I was a little kid,
he was constantly making funof handicapped people.
Really?Yeah, my whole life,
my-my dad would ridiculeanyone in a wheelchair.
It was all,"Hey, spaghetti legs!"
And, "Hey, rigatoni legs!"
And, uh, "Hey, angel-hair legs!"
He was a sales managerat Ronzoni.
Wow, then it must have beenhard for him to accept
when you wereparalyzed.
That's just it.
My dad doesn't knowI'm handicapped.
I never told him.
(sobbing): I never...I never told him!
(cries)
Ah, Joe, don't cry.
It's gonna make me cry.
(wails)
I cry like Snoopy.
(wails)
I can't believe you invitedmy father without telling me.
You guys got to getin touch with him
and tell himnot to come.
It's too late, Joe,he's already on his way.
He is?
Yeah, we got himtickets on Kayak.
It is a nightmareitinerary.
It was, like, 80 bucks,but he has four stops.
Two of them arein Houston.
What am I gonna do?
My dad has no ideaI'm paralyzed.
Well, there's onlyone thing we can do.
We'll just figure out a way
to hide your handicapfrom your dad.
Hide the factthat I can't walk?
Peter, that'llnever work.
It's worth a try.
Come on, Joe,don't be so negative.
You're like a Bostonfortune cookie.
"I don't know, numbnuts.
Maybe buy a garage and fill itwith hockey equipment."
Huh.
Well, let's seewhat my lucky numbers are.
"Screw you, math dick."
Well, that wasn'tvery helpful at all.
Here you go, Stewie.
I know clothes shoppingalways cheers you up.
I can't believe I'm onlygoing to be five-foot-one.
Aw, come on, lookat the bright side.
You'll be in the front rowof every class picture.
Holding that little plaque.
You suck.
Why don't you go drink outof the fountain?
I'll text youwhen I'm done.
I know you'retrying to be rude,
but I am gonna do that,because I find it enjoyable.
Excuse me, I waslooking at this.
Sorry, I've made a decisionto go for that shirt,
and when that happens,it is on.
Full throttle, man. Pow!
Wow, you're an energeticlittle fellow.
I guess your mommy letsyou drink coffee, huh?
Whoa, whoa, I-I don't putstimulants in my body.
You know something?
You kind of remind meof Tom Cruise.
Boom.
(laughs)
You-you got me, man.
(gasps)Wow, Tom Cruise.
You look, um...bigger in the movies.
Wh-What are youdoing here?
Oh, I get all my clothes fromout-of-the-way toddler stores.
Ooh, uh, you wantan animal cracker?
Sure, you gota lion in there?
Oh, no,I eat those first.
I believe eatingthe lions gives me power.
Yeah, I hear you believein a lot of crazy stuff.
What'd you get there?A giraffe?
Yeah.
Good, good.
It's good for eyesight.
Well, you're certainly upbeat.
Let me ask you,doesn't it bother you
being an adult manwho's that short?
'Cause the doctor saysthat's where I'm headed.
Oh, no way, man.
The middle of the word"short" is "or."
"Or" gives you a choice.
And I choose not to be short.
Wow, you need a road mapfor that one.
Hey, hey,I'll tell you what.
You spend the day with me,
you'll see how greatit is to be short.
You'll feel likeyou're discovering a new world.
And you know what's inthe middle of the word "world"?
Um... "or"?
Yes!
The dots have appeared, man,let's connect them!
(chucklesuncomfortably)
You're... you're a weirdo,but let's do this.
All right, checkit out, Bonnie.
This is how we'regonna fool Joe's dad.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, looksreal, right?
I put this pair of pantson the front legs of this horse
and strapped Joeto the front
with his legs tiedbehind the horse's neck.
And then we put Cinnamon's headup the back of Joe's shirt
and simply hid the rest of thehorse behind this curtain.
(horse whinnies)
His breath is verymoist, Peter.
And to induce movement, I'mgonna snap the horse's balls
with this dampenedkitchen towel.
Aah! Oh, my God!
Holy crap, he'sout of control!
Does it look real?
(screams)
Plan "B"! Plan "B"!
(horse neighing)
(groans) Peter, I'mafraid this is hopeless.
What, I don't knowwhat else to do.
I mean, we're notgonna come up
with something betterthan the horse.
Yeah, I guess you're justgonna have to tell your dad
about your handicap.
I can't do that.
If you guys were in my shoes,you'd understand.
Wait a minute, that's it!
I will get in your shoes.
I'll just pretend to be you.
I mean, your dad ain'tseen you in years.
He won't knowthe difference.
What? That's crazy.
(groaning)
Boy, that was a close call.
Is some of this room cold?
All right, Peter, almost done.
Huh? Huh?
Eh, kind of.
Yeah.I don't care.
Peter, I don'tknow about this.
It seems likea bad idea.
Look, Lois, Joe is oneof my best friends, all right?
I'm only doing thisto help him.
Besides, wait till you hearmy "Joe" voice.
(imitating Joe): Uh, God, I hatebeing stuck in this chair.
No, Peter,that fights it.
&#9834; Oh, yeah &#9834;
&#9834; Mr. Big Stuff &#9834;
&#9834; Who do you think you are? &#9834;
&#9834; Mr. Big Stuff &#9834;
&#9834; You're never gonnaget my love &#9834;
&#9834; Now because you wear &#9834;
&#9834; All those fancy clothes &#9834;
&#9834; Oh, yeah &#9834;
&#9834; And have a big fine car &#9834;
&#9834; Oh, yes, you do now &#9834;
&#9834; Do you think I can afford &#9834;
&#9834; To give you my love &#9834;
&#9834; Oh, yeah &#9834;
&#9834; You think you're higherthan every star above &#9834;
&#9834; Mr. Big Stuff &#9834;
&#9834; Who do you think you are? &#9834;
&#9834; Mr. Big Stuff &#9834;
&#9834; You're never gonnamake me cry &#9834;
&#9834; Mr. Big Stuff &#9834;
&#9834; Tell me, tell me... &#9834;
That's Bud.
Are you ready, Peter?
I think so.
What do you think,acting coach?
I think you will beexemplary, Peter.
All good acting coachesare insane old ladies.
Emote!
(doorbell rings)
Hi, Bud.
Hi, Joe's dad.
Uh, I mean, uh, Dad.
Uh, Joe, I'm Joe;you're my dad.
Joe?
Wow, I guess it reallyhas been a long time.
I barely recognize you.
Put on a little weight,haven't you?
Well, I could saythe same for you.
(laughs)(laughs uneasily)
Sometimes I don't understandwhy people laugh.
All right, everyone in the car.
We got a Father's Daydinner reservation.
Why is Mr. Swanson coming?
And why is he dressed like Dad?
I don't know, kids.
I stopped asking after yourfather said he shot a horse.
(siren whoops twice)
Thanks forthe ride-along.
I liked when you sentenced thosetwo girls to kiss each other.
Yeah, all girls are lesbianswhen you point a gun at 'em.
Boy, it's been greatspending time with you, son.
It's been great spendingtime with you, too...
Dad.
Oh, this'll be fun.
Let's see how long it takes them
to get Gumby over thereinto the car.
Yeah, that's our neighbor,Peter Griffin.
That's the guywho e-mailed me?
Huh, no wonder it was all capswith tons of typos.
He's a water head, right?
Yeah, he's a mess.
Look at his ugly kids.
Pathetic.
Ugh, he's not fitting.
Just put some of himin the back like skis.
Hey, Stewie.What's up?
(chuckling): When yousay it like that,
you sound justlike Tom Cruise.
What?Oh, yeah,
I've been hangingwith Tom Cruise.
You've been hanging outwith Tom Cruise?
Sure have.
We spent the wholeday together,
and he showed me
there's a lot ofadvantages to being short.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
You're the last oneto get wet when it rains?
Well, yeah, that.
And you can chowpie standing up.
We didn't do any of that,but the point is,
I'm at peacewith being short.
Full throttle, man!Pow!
(phone ringing)
Hello.
Oh, hi,Dr. Hartman.
Mrs. Griffin,I have some good news.
Turns out your sonis going to be normal height.
I read his chart wrongyesterday.
Apparently, I have somethingcalled "dislooxia"?
That was the doctor.
Apparently, Stewie's notgonna be short after all.
What? Really?
That's wonderful news!
Oh, I'm so relieved
my child is sparedsome heartache.
Now, come on, Brian, I guesswe should try to make it
over to Meg'sbirthday party.
Could I have some breadwhile I open my presents?
At this point,we're gonna have to start
charging youfor the bread.
(doorbell rings)
Hey, Stewie!
You want to check outthe go-kart
I used in Days of Thunder?
Yeah, listen, um...
I just found out I'mactually going to be tall,
so I'm no longer comfortablehanging out with someone
whose teeth are biggerthan their fingers.
What?
That's...that's barely true.
Yeah, so...see you later.
You are making a big mistake,Stewie!
Nobody walks awayfrom Tiny Tom Cruise!
Yeah, except forall three of your wives.
Okay, I'mshutting this now.
Okay, so... bye!
So now, since I switchedto disposable catheters,
I no longer have those beet-redinfections in my urethra.
Oh, no.
I hope it's not genetic.
Chris, he'snot our dad.
I can't keep up with this ruse.
Hey, everybody!
Peter, finally,you're home.
How's it going over therewith my dad?
Awesome. He fell forthe whole thing.
In fact, we've beenhaving a great time!
Wow, that'sterrific, Peter!
You'll only have to pull itoff for a few more hours.
Then he'll be on a planetomorrow and I can go home.
Oh, that'sthe other good news.
Bud's not leaving!
I told him he can move inwith me and Bonnie.
What?!
Peter, this is crazy!
Nah, it's gonnawork out fine.
Oh, and remember, Joe,
if Lois is feelingfrisky at night,
it's index fingeraround and clockwise.
And just keepdoing that to yourself
until you're good to go.
Peter, this is ridiculous.
You can't live in my housewith my dad and my family!
Your dad got mesuper clean in the tub.
Joe's right,this is idiotic.
What are you thinking?
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking thatI've had two dads
and neither one cared for meas much as Bud does.
Peter, I've hadenough of this!
You can't justtake my dad!
Well, he's rightnext door.
Nothing's stopping youfrom going over there
and telling him the truth:
that his son is a paraplegicwho's stuck in a wheelchair.
You know Ican't do that.
Ah, suit yourself.But I gotta go.
Me and Bud arehaving a blast.
I'm sorry, Joe.
A-Are you okay?
Not really.
I'll be honest,Lois, this hurts.
Hurts like the Dickens.
I've finishedmy latest novel.
Splendid, Charles!
What is it called?
Oliver Nipple-Twist.
Ow!
Oh, Charles, you bastard!
Yeah! The Dickens!
It hurts like the me!
So, anyone going tothe gerbil's funeral on Friday?
Okay, kids!
Everyone in a circlefor parachute time.
Oh, goodie,I love parachute time!
ALL:Whee!
Whee!
Whee!
What the hell?
That kid looked likeTiny Tom Cruise.
Whee!
Huh.Must've been my imagination.
Aah!
If you thinkyou're getting away from me,
you've got a crazy laughcoming, friend.
(laughs crazily)
Aah!
(continues laughing)
(panting)
Hey, what are you doing homeso early?
He's following me, Brian!
Who's following you?
Tom Cruise!
I spend one afternoonwith the guy,
and it's like I signedan eight-year contract
to show up at events with him
and let him fake-father a child.
Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise
has better things to dothan follow you around.
Oh, really?
Well, explain that!
You know, it's timeslike this where I think,
if I didn't talk andyou were a normal baby,
we wouldn't haveany of these problems.
You gotta help meget rid of him, Brian!
He's creepierthan that guy at the gym
who just does karatein the mirror.
It's me.
The guy's me.
I'm a gym karate creep.
I'm pretty good, too.
But relax.
If I wanted you dead,you'd be dead.
Hey, Dad, what do yousay we go play catch?
And throw mesome divers.
I want to get grass stainson my school slacks.
What?
You're a grown man.
I know, it's just sogreat having a dad.
Well, it's nice havingreconnected with you, too.
All right, let's do it.
Oh, for God's sake.
See, a guy like thatshould just stay inside
so we don't haveto look at him.
Joe, go over there
and tell him to getback in his house.
Don't worry, I'lltake care of it.
Joe, you gotta go inside.
You're upsetting my dad.
Your dad?That's right!
He loves mein a way that...
Aw, you guys had pizza?
Screw you, Peter!
You know what? This is over!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Not a chance.
I like your house better.
I got nothing to hold ontowhen I poop at home.
You have no idea how many showercurtains I've ripped down.
Now get inside.
No, I'm notgonna do that.
Oh, yes, you are!
Get away from me,you son of a bitch!
What the hell?
Joe, don't take thatfrom him!
(Peter grunts)
How do you like that?
You're gettingyour ass kicked by a cripple!
A helpless,spaghetti-legged cripple!
What are you doing?
You're my son!
You can't let yourselfget beat up
by a guyin a wheelchair!
Your son is a guyin a wheelchair.
What are you talking about?
(sighs)
(gasps)(gasps)
Yes.
Yes, Dad.
It's me.
(grunting)
Joe!
What the hellhappened to you?
I was shot inthe line of duty.
(laughs)"Line of duty."
So, this is why you haven'tcalled me in all these years?
How could I, Dad?
You always made funof handicapped people.
The only thing I neverunderstood was... why?
I don't know.
I guess I couldnever stand the thought
of something like thathappening to me.
Or even worse, to someonethat I care about.
One time, my legs fellasleep on the toilet.
I had to crawlinto the living room
and interruptLois' book club.
That was one of the showercurtains I ripped down.
And I suppose, deep down,I was afraid.
Afraid that, if it did happen,
I wouldn't be strong enoughto handle it.
Well, Dad, I can tell youfrom experience,
it's only whenyour worst fears come true
that you get to find outhow strong you really are.
Then I guess I've gotsome learning to do.
I love you, son.
I love you, too, Dad.I love you, too, Dad.
Hey, Joe, uh,just one question:
why do you have all thoseWizard of Oz plates?
Because if I finishmy vegetables,
I get to seethe Yellow Brick Road.
All right,you sold me.
All right, Brian,
Tiny Tom Cruiseis somewhere close.
I can sensehis manic energy.
You remember the plan?
Yup, I got it.
Help, help!My dog got off his leash!
Is there anyonewho can do a pumpy-arm run?
Running, running, running,running, running, running, run!
Hey, Stewie. I'm here to helpyou for the next billion years.
All right, good to know.
Anyway, my dog ranaround those bushes.
I am on it!
Gotcha!
All right,off to Zappos with him.
You sure thisis gonna work?
Oh, yeah.They'll accept any returns.
We don't evenhave to pay postage.
Hello, friend.Your life...
is about to change.
Hey, Tom. It's beena couple weeks.
Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorryI treated you like such a jerk.
Well, that's okay, Peter.
In fact, I got to say, itwas a nice thing you did.
I'm glad I reconnected withmy dad after all these years.
Ah, it was my pleasure.
There's no more importantrelationship than...
I'm sorry, Cleveland,what the hell
is thatToronto Raptors hat?
It was myFather's Day present.
I hate it.
I'm just gonnawear it for a week,
then sayI lost it.
Anyway, thanks forhelping me, Peter.
Yeah, it allworked out great, Joe.
Except I am still missingthat one pair of pants.
(tires screech)
Excuse me,are those Bugle Boy jeans?
